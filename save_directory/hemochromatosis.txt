SymptomsSome people with hemochromatosis never have symptoms. Early symptoms often overlap with those of other common conditions.
Symptoms may include:

Joint pain.
Abdominal pain.
Fatigue.
Weakness.
Diabetes.
Loss of sex drive.
Impotence.
Heart failure.
Liver failure.
Bronze or gray skin color.
Memory fog.

When symptoms typically appearThe most common type of hemochromatosis is present at birth. But most people don't experience symptoms until later in life — usually after age 40 in men and after age 60 in women. Women are more likely to develop symptoms after menopause, when they no longer lose iron with menstruation and pregnancy.
