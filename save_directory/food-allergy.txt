For some people, an allergic reaction to a particular food may be uncomfortable but not severe. For other people, a food allergy reaction can be frightening and even life-threatening. Food allergy symptoms usually develop within a few minutes to two hours after eating the offending food. Rarely, symptoms may be delayed for several hours.
The most common food allergy symptoms include:

Tingling or itching in the mouth.
Hives, itching or eczema.
Swelling of the lips, face, tongue, and throat or other parts of the body.
Belly pain, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting.
Wheezing, nasal congestion or trouble breathing.
Dizziness, lightheadedness or fainting.

AnaphylaxisIn some people, a food allergy can trigger a severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. This can cause life-threatening symptoms, including:

Constriction and tightening of the airways.
A swollen throat or the sensation of a lump in your throat that makes it hard to breathe.
Shock with a severe drop in blood pressure.
Rapid pulse.
Dizziness, lightheadedness or loss of consciousness.

Emergency treatment is critical for anaphylaxis. Untreated, anaphylaxis can be fatal.
