Symptoms at the site of a scorpion sting may include:

Pain, which can be intense.
Numbness and tingling.
Slight swelling.
Warmth.

Symptoms from venom that affect the whole body — usually in children who are stung — include:

A hard time breathing.
Muscle twitching or thrashing.
Unusual head, neck and eye movements.
Drooling.
Sweating.
Slurred speech.
Nausea and vomiting.
High blood pressure (hypertension).
Fast heart rate (tachycardia).
Being restless or excitable, or crying in children that can't be comforted.

As with other stinging insects, such as bees and wasps, it is possible for people who have been stung by scorpions before to have allergic reactions when stung later. Reactions to these later stings are sometimes serious enough to cause a life-threatening condition called anaphylaxis. Symptoms in these cases are like those of anaphylaxis caused by bee stings, including hives, trouble breathing, and nausea and vomiting.
