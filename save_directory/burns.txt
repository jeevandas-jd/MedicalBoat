Skin anatomy
The skin has three layers that house sweat and oil glands, hair follicles, blood vessels, and the cells that give skin its color. These cells are called melanocytes.

Third-degree burn


Third-degree burn
Third-degree burns involve all of the layers of skin and sometimes the fat and muscle tissue under the skin. The skin may appear stiff, waxy white, leathery or gray. These types of burns often need skin grafts to close the wound.

Radiation burn
Radiation burns can be caused by X-rays or radiation therapy to treat cancer.





Burn symptoms vary depending on how deep the skin damage is. It can take a day or two for the symptoms of a severe burn to develop.

First-degree burn, also called superficial burn. This minor burn affects only the outer layer of the skin, which is called the epidermis. It may cause pain and redness or other changes in skin color.
Second-degree burn, also called partial-thickness burn. This type of burn affects both the epidermis and the second layer of skin, which is called the dermis. It may cause swelling and red, white or splotchy skin. Blisters may develop, and pain can be terrible. Deep second-degree burns can cause scarring.
Third-degree burn, also called full-thickness burn. This burn involves all of the layers of skin and sometimes the fat and muscle tissue under the skin. Burned areas may be black, brown or white. The skin may look leathery. Third-degree burns can destroy nerves, so there may be little or no pain.
