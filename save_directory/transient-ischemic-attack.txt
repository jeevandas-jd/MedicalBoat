Transient ischemic attacks usually last a few minutes. Most symptoms disappear within an hour. Rarely, symptoms may last up to 24 hours. The symptoms of a TIA are similar to those found early in a stroke. Symptoms happen suddenly and may include:

Weakness, numbness or paralysis in the face, arm or leg, typically on one side of the body.
Slurred speech or trouble understanding others.
Blindness in one or both eyes or double vision.
Dizziness or loss of balance or coordination.

You may have more than one TIA. Their symptoms may be similar or different depending on which area of the brain is involved.
