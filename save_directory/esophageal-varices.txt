Esophageal varices usually don't cause symptoms unless they bleed. Symptoms of bleeding esophageal varices include:

Vomiting large amounts of blood.
Black, tarry or bloody stools.
Lightheadedness due to blood loss.
Loss of consciousness in severe cases.

Your doctor might suspect esophageal varices if you have signs of liver disease or been diagnosed with liver cirrhosis, including:

Yellow coloration of the skin and eyes, known as jaundice.
Easy bleeding or bruising.
Fluid buildup in the abdomen, called ascites (uh-SY-teez).
