The signs and symptoms of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) may include:

Dizziness
A sense that you or your surroundings are spinning or moving (vertigo)
A loss of balance or unsteadiness
Nausea
Vomiting

The signs and symptoms of BPPV can come and go and commonly last less than one minute. Episodes of BPPV can disappear for some time and then recur.
Activities that bring about the signs and symptoms of BPPV can vary from person to person, but are almost always brought on by a change in head position. Some people also feel out of balance when standing or walking.
Abnormal rhythmic eye movements usually accompany the symptoms of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.
