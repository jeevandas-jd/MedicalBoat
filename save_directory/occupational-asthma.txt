Asthma attack


Asthma attack
When a person has asthma, the inside walls of the airways in the lungs can narrow and swell. Also, the airway linings may make too much mucus. The result is an asthma attack. During an asthma attack, narrowed airways make breathing difficult and may cause coughing and wheezing.





Occupational asthma symptoms may include:

Wheezing.
Coughing.
Shortness of breath.
Chest tightness.

Other possible symptoms may include:

Runny nose.
Stuffy nose.
Itchy or watery eyes.

Occupational asthma symptoms depend on the substance you're exposed to, how long and how often you're exposed, and other factors. Your symptoms may:

Begin right after exposure to a substance, later in the day or after work.
Improve or go away on days off or during vacations and then return when you go to work.
May begin early in the day and fail to improve on days off as disease progresses.
May become permanent even after long periods away from work.
