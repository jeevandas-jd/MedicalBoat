Symptoms of a broken collarbone include:

Pain that increases when moving the shoulder.
Swelling, tenderness or bruising.
Skin over the break might look like a tent when gently pinched.
A bump on or near the shoulder.
A grinding or crackling sound when moving the shoulder.
Stiffness or not being able to move the shoulder.

Newborns often will not move their arm for days after breaking the collarbone during birth and will cry if someone moves the arm.
