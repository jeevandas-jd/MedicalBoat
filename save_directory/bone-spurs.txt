Bone spurs on spine


Bone spurs on spine
In osteoarthritis of the spine, disks narrow and bone spurs form.





Often, bone spurs don't cause symptoms. You might not know you have bone spurs until an X-ray for another condition reveals the growths. But sometimes, bone spurs can cause pain and loss of motion in your joints.
The symptoms depend on where the bone spurs are. Examples include:

Knee. Bone spurs in the knee can make it painful to extend and bend the leg.
Spine. On the small bones that form the spine, bone spurs can narrow the space that contains the spinal cord. These bone spurs can pinch the spinal cord or its nerve roots. That can cause weakness or numbness in the arms or legs.
Hip. Bone spurs can make it painful to move the hip. Sometimes, it might feel like the pain is in the knee or the thigh. Depending on their placement, bone spurs can reduce the range of motion in the hip joint.
