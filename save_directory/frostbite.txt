Symptoms of frostbite include:

Numbness.
Tingling.
Patches of skin in shades of red, white, blue, gray, purple or brown. The color of affected skin depends on how serious the frostbite is and the usual skin color.
Cold, hard, waxy-looking skin.
Clumsiness due to joint stiffness.
Pain.
Blistering after rewarming.

Frostbite is most common on the fingers, toes, ears, cheeks, penis, chin and tip of the nose. Because of numbness, you may not notice you have frostbite until someone points it out. Changes in the color of the affected area might be difficult to see on brown and Black skin.
Frostbite occurs in several stages:

Frostnip. Frostnip is the early stage of frostbite. Symptoms are pain, tingling and numbness. Frostnip doesn't cause permanent damage to the skin.
Mild to moderate frostbite. Frostbite causes slight changes in skin color. The skin may begin to feel warm. This is a sign of serious skin involvement. If you treat frostbite with rewarming at this stage, the surface of the skin may look patchy. The affected area may sting, burn and swell. A fluid-filled blister may form 12 to 36 hours after rewarming. This stage also is called superficial frostbite.
Deep frostbite. As frostbite progresses, it affects all layers of the skin and the tissues below. The affected skin turns white or blue-gray. Large blood blisters may appear 24 to 48 hours after rewarming. Weeks after the injury, tissue may turn black and hard as it dies.
