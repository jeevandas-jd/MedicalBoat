of MOGAD may include vision loss, muscle weakness, stiffness or paralysis, confusion, seizures, and headaches. These symptoms can be sometimes confused with other diseases such as multiple sclerosis.
There's no cure for MOGAD. However, there are treatments to help speed the recovery from attacks, manage symptoms and reduce the likelihood of symptoms returning.





SymptomsMOGAD causes painful swelling, known as inflammation. Symptoms are caused by attacks from:

Inflammation of the optic nerve. Called optic neuritis, this condition may lead to vision loss in one or both eyes and eye pain that gets worse with eye movement. Optic neuritis in children may be mistaken for a headache.
Inflammation of the spinal cord. Called transverse myelitis, this condition may lead to arm or leg weakness, muscle stiffness, or paralysis. It also may cause sensory loss and changes in bowel, bladder or sexual function.
Inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. Called acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, also known as ADEM, this condition may lead to vision loss, weakness, unsteady walk and confusion. ADEM is more common in children with MOGAD.

Other symptoms of MOGAD may include:

Seizures.
Headaches.
Fever.

Disease courseSome people who have MOGAD only experience one attack of symptoms. This is called monophasic MOGAD and is slightly more common. However, some people experience multiple attacks, called relapsing MOGAD. Attacks usually develop over days and can be severe and debilitating. Disability usually gets worse with each attack. Attack recovery can take weeks to months.
