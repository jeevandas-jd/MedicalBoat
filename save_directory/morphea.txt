Signs and symptoms of morphea vary depending on the type and stage of the condition. They include:

Reddish or purplish oval patches of skin, often on the belly, chest or back
Patches that gradually develop a lighter or whitish center
Linear patches, especially on the arms or legs and possibly the forehead or scalp
A gradual change in the affected skin, which becomes firm, thickened, dry and shiny

Morphea affects the skin and underlying tissue and sometimes bone. The condition generally lasts several years and then improves or at times disappears by itself. It may leave scars or areas of darkened or discolored skin. It is possible for morphea to recur.
