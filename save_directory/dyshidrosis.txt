Dyshidrosis symptoms include painful, itchy and fluid-filled blisters on the sides of the fingers, the palms of the hands and the bottoms of the feet. The blisters are small â€” about the width of a standard pencil lead. They are grouped in clusters and can look like tapioca.
With severe disease, the small blisters can merge to form larger blisters. Skin affected by dyshidrosis can be painful and very itchy. After a few weeks, the blisters dry and flake off.
Dyshidrosis tends to come back regularly for months or years.
