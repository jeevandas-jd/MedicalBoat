Wilson's disease is present at birth, but symptoms don't appear until copper levels build up in the brain, liver, eyes or another organ. Symptoms vary based on the parts of your body the disease affects.
These symptoms can include:

Tiredness and loss of appetite.
A yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eye, known as jaundice.
Golden-brown or copper-colored rings around the irises of the eyes, known as Kayser-Fleischer rings.
Fluid buildup in the legs or stomach area.
Problems with speech, swallowing or physical coordination.
Depression, mood changes and personality changes.
Having a hard time falling asleep and staying asleep.
Uncontrolled movements or muscle stiffness.
