Shaken baby syndrome symptoms and signs include:

Extreme fussiness or irritability
Difficulty staying awake
Breathing problems
Poor eating
Vomiting
Pale or bluish skin
Seizures
Paralysis
Coma

While sometimes there's bruising on the face, you may not see signs of physical injury to the child's outer body. Injuries that might not be immediately seen include bleeding in the brain and eyes, spinal cord damage, and fractures of the ribs, skull, legs and other bones. Many children with shaken baby syndrome show signs and symptoms of prior child abuse.
In mild cases of shaken baby syndrome, a child may appear normal after being shaken, but over time they may develop health or behavioral problems.
