Signs and symptoms of granulomatosis with polyangiitis can develop suddenly or over several months. The first warning signs usually involve your sinuses, throat or lungs. The condition often worsens rapidly, affecting blood vessels and the organs they supply, such as the kidneys.
Signs and symptoms of granulomatosis with polyangiitis might include:

Pus-like drainage with crusts from your nose, stuffiness, sinus infections and nosebleeds
Coughing, sometimes with bloody phlegm
Shortness of breath or wheezing
Fever
Fatigue
Joint pain
Numbness in your limbs, fingers or toes
Weight loss
Blood in your urine
Skin sores, bruising or rashes
Eye redness, burning or pain, and vision problems
Ear inflammation and hearing problems

For some people, the disease affects only the lungs. When the kidneys are affected, blood and urine tests can detect the problem. Without treatment, kidney or lung failure can occur.
