Spinal cord tumors can cause different signs and symptoms, especially as tumors grow. The tumors may affect your spinal cord or the nerve roots, blood vessels or bones of your spine. Signs and symptoms may include:

Pain at the site of the tumor due to tumor growth
Back pain, often radiating to other parts of your body
Feeling less sensitive to pain, heat and cold
Loss of bowel or bladder function
Difficulty walking, sometimes leading to falls
Back pain that's worse at night
Loss of sensation or muscle weakness, especially in your arms or legs
Muscle weakness , which may be mild or severe, in different parts of your body

Back pain is a common early symptom of spinal tumors. Pain may also spread beyond your back to your hips, legs, feet or arms and may worsen over time â€” even with treatment.
Spinal tumors progress at different rates depending on the type of tumor.
