When the heart beats too fast, it may not send enough blood to the rest of the body. So the organs and tissues may not get enough oxygen. Symptoms of ventricular tachycardia are due to a lack of oxygen. They may include:

Chest pain, called angina.
Dizziness.
Pounding heartbeat, called palpitations.
Lightheadedness.
Shortness of breath.

Ventricular tachycardia can be a medical emergency even if your symptoms are minor.
Ventricular tachycardia, sometimes called V-tach or VT, is grouped according to how long an episode lasts.

Nonsustained V-tach stops on its own within 30 seconds. Brief episodes may not cause any symptoms.
Sustained V-tach lasts more than 30 seconds. This type of ventricular tachycardia can cause serious health problems.

Symptoms of sustained V-tach may include:

Fainting.
Loss of consciousness.
Cardiac arrest or sudden death.
