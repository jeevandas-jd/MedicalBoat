Symptoms of cataracts include:

Clouded, blurred or dim vision.
Trouble seeing at night.
Sensitivity to light and glare.
Need for brighter light for reading and other activities.
Seeing "halos" around lights.
Frequent changes in eyeglass or contact lens prescription.
Fading or yellowing of colors.
Double vision in one eye.

At first, the cloudiness in your vision caused by a cataract may affect only a small part of the eye's lens. You may not notice any vision loss. As the cataract grows larger, it clouds more of your lens. More clouding changes the light passing through the lens. This may lead to symptoms you notice more.
