If you have stress incontinence, you may leak urine when you:

Cough or sneeze.
Laugh.
Bend over.
Lift something heavy.
Exercise.
Have sex.

You might not leak urine every time you do one of these things. But any activity that puts pressure on your bladder can make leaking more likely. Having a full bladder increases the chances of leaking.
