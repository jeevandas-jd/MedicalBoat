Symptoms depend on whether the tumor makes hormones, what hormone it makes and how much it makes. But many benign adrenal gland tumors don't cause symptoms because they don't make hormones.
The most common type of benign adrenal tumor, called adenoma, comes from the adrenal cortex. This type of tumor might cause symptoms such as:

Weight gain.
Easy bruising.
High blood pressure, also called hypertension.
Diabetes.
Depressed mood.
Tiredness.
Muscle weakness or cramping.

A type of benign adrenal tumor from the medulla is called pheochromocytoma. It might cause the following symptoms:

High blood pressure, also called hypertension.
Fast heartbeat.
Sweating.
Tremors.
Headache.
