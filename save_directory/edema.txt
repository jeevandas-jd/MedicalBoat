Edema in foot and ankle


Edema in foot and ankle
Swelling of the foot, ankle and leg can be bad enough to leave a dimple, also known as a pit, in the skin after pressing on the area. This swelling, called edema, is the result of too much fluid in the tissues. Congestive heart failure or the vein not working well, also known as venous insufficiency, is often the cause.





Symptoms of edema include:

Swelling or puffiness of the tissue right under the skin, especially in legs or arms.
Stretched or shiny skin.
Skin that holds a dimple, also known as pitting, after it's been pressed for a few seconds.
Swelling of the belly, also called the abdomen, so that it's bigger than usual.
Feeling of leg heaviness.
