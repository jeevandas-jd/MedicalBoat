If your child has clubfoot, here's what it might look like:

The top of the foot is usually twisted downward and inward, increasing the arch and turning the heel inward.
The foot may be turned so severely that it actually looks as if it's upside down.
The affected leg or foot may be slightly shorter.
The calf muscles in the affected leg are usually underdeveloped.

Despite its look, clubfoot itself doesn't cause any discomfort or pain.
