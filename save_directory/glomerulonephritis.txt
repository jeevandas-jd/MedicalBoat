Signs and symptoms of glomerulonephritis may vary depending on whether you have the acute or chronic form and the cause. You may notice no symptoms of chronic disease. Your first indication that something is wrong might come from the results of a routine urine test (urinalysis).
Glomerulonephritis signs and symptoms may include:

Pink or cola-colored urine from red blood cells in your urine (hematuria).
Foamy or bubbly urine due to excess protein in the urine (proteinuria).
High blood pressure (hypertension).
Fluid retention (edema) with swelling evident in your face, hands, feet and abdomen.
Urinating less than usual.
Nausea and vomiting.
Muscle cramps.
Fatigue.
