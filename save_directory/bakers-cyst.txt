In some cases, a Baker cyst causes no pain, and you may not notice it. If you do have symptoms, they might include:

Swelling behind the knee, and sometimes in the leg
Knee pain
Stiffness and inability to fully flex the knee

The symptoms may be worse after you've been active or if you've been standing for a long time.
