Ureteral obstruction might have no signs or symptoms. Signs and symptoms depend on where the obstruction occurs, whether it's partial or complete, how quickly it develops, and whether it affects one or both kidneys.
Signs and symptoms might include:

Pain.
Changes in how much urine you produce (urine output).
Difficulty urinating.
Blood in the urine.
Urinary tract infections.
High blood pressure (hypertension).
