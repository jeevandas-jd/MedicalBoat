Symptoms of a tension-type headache include:

Dull, aching head pain.
Feeling of tightness or pressure across the forehead or on the sides and back of the head.
Tenderness in the scalp, neck and shoulder muscles.

 Tension-type headaches are divided into two main categories â€” episodic and chronic.
Episodic tension-type headachesEpisodic tension-type headaches can last from 30 minutes to a week. Frequent episodic tension-type headaches occur less than 15 days a month for at least three months. This type of headache can become chronic.
Chronic tension-type headachesThis type of tension-type headache lasts hours and may be constant. Chronic tension-type headaches occur 15 or more days a month for at least three months.
Tension-type headaches versus migrainesTension-type headaches can be hard to tell apart from migraines. And if you have frequent episodic tension-type headaches, you also can have migraines.
But unlike some forms of migraine, tension-type headaches usually aren't associated with visual disturbances such as seeing bright spots or flashes of light. People with tension-type headaches also don't usually experience nausea or vomiting with head pain. While physical activity tends to make migraine pain worse, it doesn't affect tension-type headache pain. Sometimes a tension-type headache occurs with sensitivity to light or sound, but this symptom isn't common.
