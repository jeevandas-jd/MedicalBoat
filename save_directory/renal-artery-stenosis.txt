Renal artery stenosis often doesn't cause any signs or symptoms until it's advanced. The condition may be discovered incidentally during testing for something else. Your health care provider may also suspect a problem if you have:

High blood pressure that begins suddenly or worsens without explanation
High blood pressure that begins before age 30 or after age 50

As renal artery stenosis progresses, other signs and symptoms may include:

High blood pressure that's hard to control
A whooshing sound as blood flows through a narrowed vessel (bruit), which your doctor hears through a stethoscope placed over your kidneys
Elevated protein levels in the urine or other signs of a problem with kidney function
Worsening kidney function during treatment for high blood pressure
Fluid overload and swelling in your body's tissues
Treatment-resistant heart failure
