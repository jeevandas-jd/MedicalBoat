Spider veins


Spider veins
Spider veins appear as thin, red lines or as weblike networks of blood vessels on the surface of the skin. Spider veins, a mild form of varicose veins, most often appear on the legs and feet.





Varicose veins might not cause pain. Symptoms of varicose veins include:

Veins that are dark purple, blue or the same color as the skin. Depending on skin color, these changes may be harder or easier to see.
Veins that look twisted and bulging. They often look like cords on the legs.

When there are painful symptoms of varicose veins, they might include:

An achy or heavy feeling in the legs.
Burning, throbbing, muscle cramping and swelling in the lower legs.
Worse pain after sitting or standing for a long time.
Itching around one or more of the veins.
Changes in skin color around a varicose vein.

Spider veins are like varicose veins, but they're smaller. Spider veins are found closer to the skin's surface and might look like a spider's web.
Spider veins occur on the legs but also can be found on the face. They vary in size and often look like a spider's web.
