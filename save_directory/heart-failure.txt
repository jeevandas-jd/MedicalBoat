Heart failure


Heart failure
Heart failure occurs when the heart muscle doesn't pump blood as well as it should. Blood often backs up and causes fluid to build up in the lungs and in the legs. The fluid buildup can cause shortness of breath and swelling of the legs and feet. Poor blood flow may cause the skin to appear blue or gray. Depending on your skin color, these color changes may be harder or easier to see. Some types of heart failure can lead to an enlarged heart.





If you have heart failure, your heart can't supply enough blood to meet your body's needs.
Symptoms may develop slowly. Sometimes, heart failure symptoms start suddenly. Heart failure symptoms may include:

Shortness of breath with activity or when lying down.
Fatigue and weakness.
Swelling in the legs, ankles and feet.
Rapid or irregular heartbeat.
Reduced ability to exercise.
Wheezing.
A cough that doesn't go away or a cough that brings up white or pink mucus with spots of blood.
Swelling of the belly area.
Very rapid weight gain from fluid buildup.
Nausea and lack of appetite.
Difficulty concentrating or decreased alertness.
Chest pain if heart failure is caused by a heart attack.
