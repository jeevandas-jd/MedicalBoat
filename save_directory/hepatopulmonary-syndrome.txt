Often, there are no symptoms of hepatopulmonary syndrome. If there are symptoms, they can include:

Shortness of breath that's worse when sitting or standing and gets better when lying down.
Clubbing of the fingers, in which the fingertips spread out and become rounder than usual.
Broken blood vessels under the skin, called spider angioma.
Bluish tinge of the lips and skin in white people. In Black and brown people, the lips or tongue might look light gray. This change in color is called cyanosis.
