Some people with dural arteriovenous fistulas (dAVFs) may not have symptoms. When symptoms occur, they may be characterized as benign or aggressive. An aggressive dAVF has more-serious symptoms.
Aggressive dAVF symptoms can result from bleeding in the brain, known as intracerebral hemorrhage. Bleeding in the brain often causes a sudden headache. It also may cause other symptoms based on the location and size of the hemorrhage.
Aggressive symptoms also may result from nonhemorrhagic neurological deficits (NHNDs), which can include seizures or changes in mental abilities. These symptoms usually develop more gradually, over days to weeks. Symptoms are typically related to the area of the brain affected.
Aggressive symptoms can include:

Sudden headache.
Trouble walking and falls.
Seizures.
Speech or language issues.
Facial pain.
Dementia.
Slowed movement, stiffness and tremor, known as parkinsonism.
Trouble with coordination.
Burning or prickling sensations.
Weakness.
Lack of interest, known as apathy.
Failure to thrive.
Symptoms related to increased pressure, such as headaches, nausea and vomiting.

Other dAVF symptoms can include hearing issues. People with hearing symptoms may hear a rhythmic sound in the ear that occurs with the heartbeat, known as pulsatile tinnitus. Symptoms also may include trouble with vision, such as:

Vision changes.
Eye bulge.
Swelling in the eye lining.
Paralysis of a muscle in or around the eye.

Rarely, dementia may occur due to increased pressure in the blood vessels in the brain.
