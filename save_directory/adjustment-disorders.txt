Symptoms depend on the type of adjustment disorder. These symptoms can vary from person to person. You experience more stress than would generally be expected in response to a trying event, and this stress causes a lot of problems in your life.
Adjustment disorders affect how you feel and think about yourself and the world. They also may affect your actions or behavior.
Some examples include:

Feeling sad, hopeless or not enjoying things you used to enjoy.
Crying often.
Worrying, or feeling anxious, nervous, jittery or stressed out.
Feeling irritable or like you can't handle anything and don't know where to start.
Having trouble sleeping.
Not eating enough.
Having difficulty concentrating.
Having difficulty with daily activities.
Withdrawing from family and friends who support you socially.
Not doing important things, such as going to work or paying bills.
Thinking about suicide or acting on those thoughts.

Symptoms of an adjustment disorder start within three months of a stressful event. These symptoms last no longer than six months after the end of the stressful event. But constant or lasting adjustment disorders can continue for more than six months. This is especially true if the stressful event is ongoing, such as being unemployed.
