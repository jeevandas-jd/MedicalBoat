Ductal carcinoma in situ doesn't typically cause symptoms. This early form of breast cancer also is called DCIS.
DCIS can sometimes cause symptoms such as:

A breast lump.
Bloody nipple discharge.

DCIS is usually found on a mammogram. It appears as tiny flecks of calcium in the breast tissue. These are calcium deposits, often referred to as calcifications.
