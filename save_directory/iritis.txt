Iritis can occur in one or both eyes. It usually develops suddenly, and can last up to three months.
Signs and symptoms of iritis include:

Eye redness
Discomfort or achiness in the affected eye

Iritis that develops suddenly, over hours or days, is known as acute iritis. Symptoms that develop gradually or last longer than three months indicate chronic iritis.
