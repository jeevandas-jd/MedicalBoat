Congenital myasthenic syndromes are typically identified at birth. But if signs and symptoms are mild, the condition may not be identified until childhood, or rarely, early adulthood.
Depending on the type of congenital myasthenic syndrome, the severity of signs and symptoms vary greatly, from minor weakness to the inability to move. Some symptoms can be life-threatening.
Common to all congenital myasthenic syndromes is muscle weakness that worsens with physical activity. Any muscles used for movement can be affected, but the most commonly affected muscles are those that control movement of the eyelids and eyes and chewing and swallowing.
During infancy and early childhood, progressive loss of essential voluntary muscle activity occurs with muscle use. Impaired muscle weakness can result in: 

Droopy eyelids and poor eye control, often with double vision.
Difficulty chewing and swallowing.
Weakness of facial muscles.
Weak cry.
Slurring or nasal speech.
Delayed crawling and walking.
Delayed development of wrist, hand and finger skills, such as brushing teeth or combing hair.
Trouble supporting the head in an upright position.
Problems breathing, such as feeling short of breath and having short pauses in breathing, sometimes worsened by infection, fever or stress.

Depending on the type of congenital myasthenic syndrome, other signs and symptoms can include:

Skeletal deformities, such as joint, spine or foot deformities.
Unusual facial features, such as narrow jaw or wide-set eyes.
Hearing loss.
Weakness, numbness and pain, usually in hands and feet.
Seizures.
Kidney problems.
Cognitive impairment, rarely.
