The development of Barrett's esophagus is most often attributed to long-standing GERD, which may include these signs and symptoms:

Frequent heartburn and regurgitation of stomach contents
Difficulty swallowing food
Less commonly, chest pain

Curiously, approximately half of the people diagnosed with Barrett's esophagus report little if any symptoms of acid reflux. So, you should discuss your digestive health with your doctor regarding the possibility of Barrett's esophagus.
