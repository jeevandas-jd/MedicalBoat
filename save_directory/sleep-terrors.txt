Sleep terrors differ from nightmares. A nightmare is a bad dream. The person who has a nightmare wakes up from the dream and may remember details. A person who has a sleep terror remains asleep. Children usually don't remember anything about their sleep terrors in the morning. Adults may recall part of a dream they had during the sleep terrors.
Sleep terrors generally happen in the first part of sleep time, and rarely during naps. A sleep terror may lead to sleepwalking.
During a sleep terror, a person may:

Start by screaming, shouting or crying.
Sit up in bed and look scared.
Stare wide-eyed.
Sweat, breathe heavily, and have a racing pulse, flushed face and enlarged pupils.
Kick and thrash.
Be hard to wake up and be confused if awakened.
Not be comforted or soothed.
Have no or little memory of the event the next morning.
Possibly, get out of bed and run around the house or have aggressive behavior if blocked or held back.
