How bad symptoms are varies greatly between people with CVID. Symptoms of common variable immunodeficiency may appear during childhood or the teen years. But many people don't get symptoms until they're adults.
If you have CVID, you'll likely have repeated infections before being diagnosed. The most common types of infections include pneumonia, sinusitis, ear infections and gastrointestinal infections.
