Inflammatory breast cancer doesn't commonly form a lump, as occurs with other forms of breast cancer. Instead, signs and symptoms of inflammatory breast cancer include:

Fast change in the appearance of one breast, over the course of several weeks.
Thickness, heaviness or swelling of one breast.
Changes in skin color, giving the breast a red, purple, pink or bruised appearance.
Unusual warmth of the affected breast.
Dimpling or ridges on the skin of the affected breast, similar to an orange peel.
Tenderness, pain or aching.
Enlarged lymph nodes under the arm, above the collarbone or below the collarbone.
Flattened nipple or nipple that turns inward on the affected breast.

For inflammatory breast cancer to be diagnosed, these symptoms must have been present for less than six months.
