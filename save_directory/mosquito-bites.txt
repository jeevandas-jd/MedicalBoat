Mosquito bites often happen on parts of the body that aren't covered by clothing. Symptoms include:

An itchy, inflamed bump that forms a few minutes after a bite
A painful spot that looks like a hive and forms within 24 hours after a bite
Small blisters

A severe reaction to mosquito bites can cause:

A large, swollen, inflamed area
A hive-like rash
Swelling around the eyes

Children are more likely to have a severe reaction than are adults.
