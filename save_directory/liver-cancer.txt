The liver
The liver is the largest internal organ in the body. It's about the size of a football. It sits mainly in the upper right portion of the stomach area, above the stomach.





Most people don't have signs and symptoms in the early stages of primary liver cancer. When signs and symptoms do appear, they may include:

Losing weight without trying
Loss of appetite
Upper abdominal pain
Nausea and vomiting
General weakness and fatigue
Abdominal swelling
Yellow discoloration of your skin and the whites of your eyes (jaundice)
White, chalky stools
