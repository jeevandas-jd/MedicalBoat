Breast pain can be cyclic or noncyclic. Cyclic means that the pain occurs on a regular pattern. Noncyclic means that the pain is constant, or that there's not a regular pattern. Each type of breast pain has distinct characteristics.

Breast pain characteristics


Cyclic breast pain
Noncyclic breast pain






Clearly related to the menstrual cycle and changing hormone levels
Described as dull, heavy or aching
Often accompanied by breast swelling, fullness or lumpiness
Usually affects both breasts, particularly the upper, outer portions, and can radiate to the underarm
Intensifies during the two weeks leading up to the start of the menstrual period, then eases up afterward
More likely to affect people in their 20s and 30s, as well as people in their 40s who are transitioning to menopause




Unrelated to the menstrual cycle
Described as tight, burning, stabbing or aching sensation
Constant or intermittent
Usually affects one breast, in a localized area, but may spread more diffusely across the breast
In women, most likely to occur after menopause





Extramammary breast painThe term "extramammary" means "outside the breast." Extramammary breast pain feels like it starts in the breast tissue, but its source is actually outside the breast area. Pulling a muscle in the chest, for example, can cause pain in the chest wall or rib cage that spreads (radiates) to the breast. Arthritis that involves the cartilage in the chest, also known as costochondritis, can also cause pain.
