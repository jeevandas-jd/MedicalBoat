A varicocele usually occurs on the left side of the scrotum and often produces no signs or symptoms. Possible signs and symptoms may include:

Pain. A dull, aching pain or discomfort is more likely when standing or late in the day. Lying down often relieves pain.
A mass in the scrotum. If a varicocele is large enough, a mass like a "bag of worms" may be visible above the testicle. A smaller varicocele may be too small to see but noticeable by touch.
Differently sized testicles. The affected testicle may be noticeably smaller than the other testicle.
Infertility. A varicocele may lead to difficulty fathering a child, but not all varicoceles cause infertility.
