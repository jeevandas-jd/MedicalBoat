STDs can have a range of symptoms, including no symptoms. That's why sexually transmitted infections may go unnoticed until a person has complications or a partner is diagnosed.
STI symptoms might include:

Sores or bumps on the genitals or in the oral or rectal area.
Painful or burning urination.
Discharge from the penis.
Unusual or odorous vaginal discharge.
Unusual vaginal bleeding.
Pain during sex.
Sore, swollen lymph nodes, particularly in the groin but sometimes more widespread.
Lower abdominal pain.
Fever.
Rash over the trunk, hands or feet.

Sexually transmitted infection symptoms may appear a few days after exposure. But it may take years before you have any noticeable problems, depending on what's causing the STI.
