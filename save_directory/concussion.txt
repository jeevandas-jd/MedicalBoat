The symptoms of a concussion can be subtle and may not occur right away. Symptoms can last for days, weeks or even longer.
Common symptoms after a mild traumatic brain injury are headache, confusion and loss of memory, known as amnesia. The amnesia usually involves forgetting the event that caused the concussion.
Physical symptoms of a concussion may include:

Headache.
Ringing in the ears.
Nausea.
Vomiting.
Fatigue or drowsiness.
Blurry vision.

Other symptoms of a concussion include:

Confusion or feeling as if in a fog.
Amnesia surrounding the event.
Dizziness or "seeing stars."

A witness may observe these symptoms in the person with a concussion:

Temporary loss of consciousness, though this doesn't always occur.
Slurred speech.
Delayed response to questions.
Dazed appearance.
Forgetfulness, such as asking the same question over and over.

Some symptoms of a concussion occur right away. But sometimes symptoms may not occur for days after the injury, such as:

Trouble with concentration and memory.
Irritability and other personality changes.
Sensitivity to light and noise.
Trouble with sleep.
Feeling emotional or depressed.
Changes in taste and smell.
