The main symptom of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is a very fast heartbeat that may last for a few minutes to a few days. The heart beats 100 or more times a minute. Usually during SVT, the heart beats 150 to 220 times a minute. The fast heartbeat may come and go suddenly.
Symptoms of supraventricular tachycardia may include:

Pounding or fluttering feelings in the chest, called palpitations.
A pounding sensation in the neck.
Chest pain.
Fainting or almost fainting.
Lightheadedness or dizziness.
Shortness of breath.
Sweating.
Weakness or extreme tiredness.

Some people with SVT do not notice symptoms.
In infants and very young children, symptoms of SVT may be vague. The symptoms can include sweating, poor feeding, a change in skin color and a rapid pulse. If your infant or young child has any of these symptoms, talk with a healthcare professional.
