Pulmonary embolism symptoms can vary greatly, depending on how much of your lung is involved, the size of the clots, and whether you have underlying lung or heart disease.
Common symptoms include:

Shortness of breath. This symptom usually appears suddenly. Trouble catching your breath happens even when resting and gets worse with physical activity.
Chest pain. You may feel like you're having a heart attack. The pain is often sharp and felt when you breathe in deeply. The pain can stop you from being able to take a deep breath. You also may feel it when you cough, bend or lean over.
Fainting. You may pass out if your heart rate or blood pressure drops suddenly. This is called syncope.

Other symptoms that can occur with pulmonary embolism include:

A cough that may include bloody or blood-streaked mucus
Rapid or irregular heartbeat
Lightheadedness or dizziness
Excessive sweating
Fever
Leg pain or swelling, or both, usually in the back of the lower leg
Clammy or discolored skin, called cyanosis
