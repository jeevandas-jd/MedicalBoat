Frontal lobe seizures often last less than 30 seconds. Sometimes recovery is immediate.
Symptoms of frontal lobe seizures might include:

Head and eye movement to one side.
Not responding to others or having trouble speaking.
Explosive screams, including profanities or laughter.
Body posturing. A common posture is extending one arm while the other flexes, as if the person is posing like a fencer.
Repetitive movements. These may include rocking, bicycle pedaling or pelvic thrusting.
