Often, compression of the celiac artery doesn't cause any symptoms.
However, those with median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS) can have long-term (chronic) stomach pain. The symptoms may be due to a lack of blood flow through the celiac artery or compression on nerves in the area.
Symptoms of MALS include:

Pain in the upper middle stomach area, which may go away when leaning forward
Stomach pain after eating, exercising or changing body position
Bloating
Diarrhea
Fear of eating food due to pain, leading to significant weight loss â€” usually greater than 20 pounds (9.1 kilograms)
Nausea and vomiting
