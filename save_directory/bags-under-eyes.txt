Symptoms of bags under eyes can include:

Mild swelling
Saggy or loose skin
Dark circles

When to see a health care providerYou may not like the way they look, but bags under eyes are usually harmless and don't require medical care. See your health care provider if the condition causes vision problems, irritation or headaches or is accompanied by skin rash.
Your health care provider will want to rule out other possible causes that can contribute to the swelling, such as thyroid disease, infection, connective tissue disease or an allergy. You may be referred to a health care provider who specializes in the eyes (ophthalmologist), plastic surgery or plastic surgery of the eyes (oculoplastic surgeon).
