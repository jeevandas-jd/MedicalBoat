Most often, menopause happens over time. The months or years leading up to menopause are called perimenopause or the menopausal transition.
During the transition, the amount of hormones your ovaries make varies. Perimenopause can last 2 to 8 years. The average is about four years.
The hormone changes can cause symptoms such as:

Irregular periods.
Vaginal dryness.
Hot flashes.
Night sweats.
Sleep problems.
Mood changes.
Trouble finding words and remembering, often called brain fog.

Different people have different menopause symptoms. Most often, periods are not regular before they end.
Skipped periods during perimenopause are common and expected. Often, menstrual periods skip a month and return. Or they skip a few months and then start monthly cycles again for a few months.
Period cycles tend to get shorter in early perimenopause, so periods are closer together. As menopause gets closer, periods get farther apart for months before they end.
You can still get pregnant during this time. If you've skipped a period but aren't sure it's due to menopause, think about taking a pregnancy test.
