such as confusion, seizures and loss of consciousness need emergency treatment. Early diagnosis and treatment of Reye's syndrome can save a child's life.
Aspirin has been linked with Reye's syndrome in children or teenagers who have the flu or chickenpox. Do not give children or teenagers aspirin. To treat fever or pain, consider giving your child infants' or children's acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others). Infants' or children's acetaminophen and ibuprofen medicines are safer alternatives to aspirin. Talk to your healthcare professional if you have concerns.
