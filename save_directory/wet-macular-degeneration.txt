Wet macular degeneration symptoms usually appear suddenly and worsen quickly. They may include:

Visual distortions, such as straight lines seeming bent.
Reduced central vision in one or both eyes.
The need for brighter light when reading or doing close-up work.
Difficulty adjusting to low light levels, such as when entering a dimly lit restaurant or theater.
Increased blurriness of printed words.
Difficulty recognizing faces.
A well-defined blurry spot or blind spot in the field of vision.

Macular degeneration doesn't affect side vision, so it doesn't cause total blindness.
