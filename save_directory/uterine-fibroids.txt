Fibroid locations


Fibroid locations
There are three major types of uterine fibroids. Intramural fibroids grow within the muscular uterine wall. Submucosal fibroids bulge into the uterine cavity. Subserosal fibroids project to the outside of the uterus. Some submucosal or subserosal fibroids may be pedunculated. This means they hang from a stalk inside or outside the uterus.





Many people who have uterine fibroids don't have any symptoms. In those who do, symptoms can be influenced by the location, size and number of fibroids.
The most common symptoms of uterine fibroids include:

Heavy menstrual bleeding or painful periods.
Longer or more frequent periods.
Pelvic pressure or pain.
Frequent urination or trouble urinating.
Growing stomach area.
Constipation.
Pain in the stomach area or lower back, or pain during sex.

Rarely, a fibroid can cause sudden, serious pain when it outgrows its blood supply and starts to die.
Often, fibroids are grouped by their location. Intramural fibroids grow within the muscular wall of the uterus. Submucosal fibroids bulge into the uterine cavity. Subserosal fibroids form on the outside of the uterus.
