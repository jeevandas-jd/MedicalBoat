Thyroid gland
The thyroid gland sits at the base of the neck.





Most thyroid cancers don't cause any signs or symptoms early in the disease. As thyroid cancer grows, it may cause:

A lump (nodule) that can be felt through the skin on your neck
A feeling that close-fitting shirt collars are becoming too tight
Changes to your voice, including increasing hoarseness
Difficulty swallowing
Swollen lymph nodes in your neck
Pain in your neck and throat
