Bulimia symptoms may include:

Living in fear of gaining weight and trying to lose weight in unhealthy ways.
Repeatedly eating unusually large amounts of food in one sitting.
Feeling a loss of control during binge eating. You may feel like you can't stop eating or can't control what you eat.
Vomiting on purpose or exercising to extremes after binge eating so that you don't gain weight.
Using medicines that make you urinate, called water pills or diuretics, or laxatives or enemas to pass stool when they're not needed.
Fasting, limiting calories or not eating certain foods between binges.
Using dietary supplements or herbal products for weight loss. These products can be dangerous.
Being very unhappy with your body shape and weight.
Letting your body shape and weight guide how you feel about yourself and your worth.
Having extreme mood swings.

People with bulimia may use different methods to purge. The severity of bulimia depends on the number of times a week that you purge and the problems caused by doing so.
