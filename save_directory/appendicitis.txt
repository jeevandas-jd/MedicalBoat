Symptoms of appendicitis may include:

Sudden pain that begins on the right side of the lower belly.
Sudden pain that begins around the belly button and often shifts to the lower right belly.
Pain that worsens with coughing, walking or making other jarring movements.
Nausea and vomiting.
Loss of appetite.
Low-grade fever that may rise as the illness worsens.
Constipation or diarrhea.
Belly bloating.
Gas.

The site of the pain may vary, depending on age and the position of the appendix. In pregnancy, the pain may seem to come from the upper belly because the appendix is higher during pregnancy.
