An orgasm is a peak feeling of intense pleasure in response to stimulating sexual activity.
Vaginal penetration during sex indirectly stimulates the clitoris. But this may not be enough stimulation for orgasm. Many women may also need direct manual or oral stimulation of the clitoris to reach orgasm.
Anorgasmia, or female orgasmic disorder, is defined as experiencing any of these in a significant way:

Delayed orgasm.
Absence of orgasm.
Fewer orgasms.
Less-intense orgasms.

Anorgasmia can also be:

Lifelong, if you've never had an orgasm.
Acquired, if you have new problems with having orgasms.
Situational, if you have problems with orgasm only in certain situations, with certain kinds of stimulation or with certain partners.
Generalized, if you have problems with orgasm in any situation.

Women who don't always reach orgasm during sexual encounters may not find it distressing. In that case, the lack of an orgasm is not considered a disorder.
