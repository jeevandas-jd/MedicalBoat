Tics — sudden, brief, intermittent movements or sounds — are the hallmark sign of Tourette syndrome. They can range from mild to severe. Severe symptoms might significantly interfere with communication, daily functioning and quality of life.
Tics are classified as:

Simple tics. These sudden, brief and repetitive tics involve a limited number of muscle groups.
Complex tics. These distinct, coordinated patterns of movements involve several muscle groups.

Tics can also involve movement (motor tics) or sounds (vocal tics). Motor tics usually begin before vocal tics do. But the spectrum of tics that people experience is diverse.

Common motor tics seen in Tourette syndrome

Common vocal tics seen in Tourette syndrome

Coughing

Barking




In addition, tics can:

Vary in type, frequency and severity
Worsen if you're ill, stressed, anxious, tired or excited
Occur during sleep
Change over time
Worsen in the early teenage years and improve during the transition into adulthood

Before the onset of motor or vocal tics, you'll likely experience an uncomfortable bodily sensation (premonitory urge) such as an itch, a tingle or tension. Expression of the tic brings relief. With great effort, some people with Tourette syndrome can temporarily stop or hold back a tic.
