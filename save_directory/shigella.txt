Symptoms of shigella infection usually start a day or two after contact with the germs that cause it. Sometimes, the illness takes up to a week to start.
Symptoms can include:

Diarrhea that may contain blood or mucus, and that may last more than three days.
Stomach pain or cramps.
A feeling of needing to pass stool even when the bowel is empty.
Fever.
Upset stomach or vomiting.

Symptoms tend to last up to seven days. Sometimes they last longer. Some people have no symptoms after they've been infected with shigella. But the germs may be able to spread through the stool for up to a few weeks.
