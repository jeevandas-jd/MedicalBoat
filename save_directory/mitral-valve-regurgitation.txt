Mitral valve regurgitation is often mild and develops slowly. Some people do not have symptoms for many years.
But sometimes, mitral valve regurgitation develops quickly. When this happens, it's called acute mitral valve regurgitation.
Fatigue is a common but nonspecific symptom of mitral valve regurgitation. Other symptoms of mitral valve regurgitation include:

Irregular heartbeat, called an arrhythmia.
Shortness of breath, especially when lying down.
Feelings of a rapid, pounding or fluttering heartbeat, called palpitations.
Swollen feet or ankles.
