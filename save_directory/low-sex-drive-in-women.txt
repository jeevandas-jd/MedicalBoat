neither of you may have a sex drive that's outside what's typical for people at your stage in life.
And even if your sex drive is lower than it once was, your relationship may be strong. Bottom line: There is no magic number to define low sex drive. It varies.
Symptoms of low sex drive in women include:

Having less or no interest in any type of sexual activity, including masturbation.
Never or only seldom having sexual fantasies or thoughts.
Being sad or concerned about your lack of sexual activity or fantasies.
