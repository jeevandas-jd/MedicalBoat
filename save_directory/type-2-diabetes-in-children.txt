Type 2 diabetes in children may develop so gradually that there are no noticeable symptoms. Sometimes, the disorder is diagnosed during a routine check-up.
Some children might experience these signs and symptoms as a result of too much sugar in their bloodstreams:

Increased thirst
Frequent urination
Increased hunger
Fatigue
Blurry vision
Darkened areas of skin, most often around the neck or in the armpits and groin
Unintended weight loss, although this is less common in children with type 2 diabetes than in children with type 1 diabetes
Frequent infections
