A brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM) may not cause any symptoms until the AVM bursts and bleeds, known as a hemorrhage. In about half of all brain AVMs, a hemorrhage is the first sign of the malformation.
But some people with brain AVMs may experience symptoms other than bleeding, such as:

Seizures.
Headaches or pain in one area of the head.
Muscle weakness or numbness in one part of the body.

Some people may experience more-serious symptoms depending on the location of the AVM, including:

A very bad headache.
Weakness, numbness or paralysis.
Vision loss.
Trouble speaking.
Confusion or not being able to understand others.
Trouble with walking.

Symptoms of a brain AVM may begin at any age but usually appear between ages 10 and 40. Brain AVMs can damage brain tissue over time. The effects slowly build and often cause symptoms in early adulthood.
By middle age, however, brain AVMs tend to remain stable and are less likely to cause symptoms.
