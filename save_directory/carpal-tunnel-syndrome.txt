Symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome usually start gradually and include:


Tingling and numbness. Tingling and numbness may occur in the fingers or hand. Usually the thumb, index, middle and ring fingers are affected, but not the little finger. You might have a feeling like an electric shock in these fingers. These symptoms often occur while holding a steering wheel, phone or newspaper, or they may wake you from sleep.
The sensation also can travel from the wrist up the arm.
Many people "shake out" their hands to try to relieve their symptoms. The numb feeling may become constant over time.

Weakness. People with carpal tunnel syndrome may experience weakness in the hand and drop objects. This may be due to numbness or to weakness of the thumb's pinching muscles, which also are controlled by the median nerve.
