Heart attack


Heart attack
A heart attack occurs when an artery supplying the heart with blood and oxygen becomes blocked. Fatty deposits build up over time, forming plaques in the heart's arteries. If a plaque ruptures, a blood clot can form and block the arteries, causing a heart attack. During a heart attack, tissue in the heart muscle dies due to lack of blood flow through the heart's arteries.





Angina symptoms include chest pain and discomfort. The chest pain or discomfort may feel like:

Burning.
Fullness.
Pressure.
Squeezing.

Pain also may be felt in the arms, neck, jaw, shoulder or back.
Other symptoms of angina include:

Dizziness.
Fatigue.
Nausea.
Shortness of breath.
Sweating.

The severity, duration and type of angina can vary. New or different symptoms may signal unstable angina or a heart attack.
Any new or worsening angina symptoms need to be checked immediately by a healthcare professional. The healthcare team can determine whether you have stable or unstable angina.
Angina in womenSymptoms of angina in women can be different from the classic angina symptoms. These differences may lead to delays in seeking treatment. For example, chest pain may not be the only symptom or the most common symptom. Other symptoms of angina in women may include:

Discomfort in the neck, jaw, teeth or back.
Nausea.
Shortness of breath.
Stabbing pain instead of chest pressure.
Stomach pain.
