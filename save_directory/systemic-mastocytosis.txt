Signs and symptoms of systemic mastocytosis depend on the part of the body affected by excessive mast cells. Too many mast cells can build up in the skin, liver, spleen, bone marrow or intestines. Less commonly, other organs such as the brain, heart or lungs also may be affected.
Signs and symptoms of systemic mastocytosis may include:

Flushing, itching or hives
Abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting
Anemia or bleeding disorders
Bone and muscle pain
Enlarged liver, spleen or lymph nodes
Depression, mood changes or problems concentrating

The mast cells are triggered to produce substances that cause inflammation and symptoms. People have different triggers, but the most common ones include:

Alcohol
Skin irritation
Spicy foods
Exercise
Insect stings
Certain medications
