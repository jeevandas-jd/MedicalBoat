Loss of muscle control, such as clumsiness and problems walking.
Muscle weakness and floppiness.
Stiff and awkward movements.
Vision problems, such as vision loss and eye movements that can't be controlled.
Hearing loss.
Being sensitive to touch.
Problems sleeping.
Problems swallowing and eating.
Slurred speech.
Problems with learning and memory that get worse.
Mental health conditions, such as depression, paranoia and behavior problems.

Some infants with type A show symptoms within the first few months of life. Those with type B may not show symptoms for years and have a better chance of living to adulthood. People with type C can start to have symptoms at any age but may not have any symptoms until adulthood.
