Migraines, which affect children and teenagers as well as adults, can progress through four stages: prodrome, aura, attack and post-drome. Not everyone who has migraines goes through all stages.
ProdromeOne or two days before a migraine, you might notice subtle changes that warn of an upcoming migraine, including:

Constipation.
Mood changes, from depression to euphoria.
Food cravings.
Neck stiffness.
Increased urination.
Fluid retention.
Frequent yawning.

AuraFor some people, an aura might occur before or during migraines. Auras are reversible symptoms of the nervous system. They're usually visual but can also include other disturbances. Each symptom usually begins gradually, builds up over several minutes and can last up to 60 minutes.
Examples of migraine auras include:

Visual phenomena, such as seeing various shapes, bright spots or flashes of light.
Vision loss.
Pins and needles sensations in an arm or leg.
Weakness or numbness in the face or one side of the body.
Difficulty speaking.

AttackA migraine usually lasts from 4 to 72 hours if untreated. How often migraines occur varies from person to person. Migraines might occur rarely or strike several times a month.
During a migraine, you might have:

Pain usually on one side of your head, but often on both sides.
Pain that throbs or pulses.
Sensitivity to light, sound, and sometimes smell and touch.
Nausea and vomiting.

Post-dromeAfter a migraine attack, you might feel drained, confused and washed out for up to a day. Some people report feeling elated. Sudden head movement might bring on the pain again briefly.
