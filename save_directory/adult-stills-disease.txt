Most people with adult Still disease have a combination of the following symptoms:

Fever. Fever may rise to at least 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.9 degrees Celsius). The fever may spike once or twice a day for a week or longer. 
Rash. A rash might come and go with the fever. The rash usually appears on the trunk, arms or legs.
Sore throat. This is one of the first symptoms of adult Still disease. The lymph nodes in the neck might be swollen and tender.
Achy and swollen joints. Joints — especially in the knees and wrists— might be stiff, painful and inflamed. Ankles, elbows, hands and shoulders also might ache. The joint discomfort usually lasts at least two weeks.
Muscle pain. Muscular pain usually comes and goes with the fever. The pain can be severe enough to disrupt daily activities.

Symptoms of this disorder can differ from person to person. They can mimic those of other conditions, including lupus and a type of cancer called lymphoma.
