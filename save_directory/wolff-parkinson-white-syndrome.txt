The heart rate is the number of times the heart beats each minute. A fast heart rate is called tachycardia (tak-ih-KAHR-dee-uh).
The most common symptom of Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a heart rate greater than 100 beats a minute.
In WPW syndrome, the fast heartbeat can begin suddenly. It may last a few seconds or several hours. Episodes may occur during exercise or while at rest.
Other symptoms of WPW syndrome may depend on the speed of the heartbeat and the underlying heart rhythm disorder.
For example, the most common irregular heartbeat seen with WPW syndrome is supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). During an episode of  SVT, the heart beats about 150 to 220 times a minute, but it can occasionally beat faster or slower.
Some people with WPW syndrome also have a fast and chaotic heart rhythm disorder called atrial fibrillation.
In general, symptoms of WPW syndrome include:

Rapid, fluttering or pounding heartbeats.
Chest pain.
Difficulty breathing.
Dizziness or lightheadedness.
Fainting.
Fatigue.
Shortness of breath.
Anxiety.

Symptoms in infantsInfants with WPW may have other symptoms, such as:

Blue or gray skin, lips and nails. These changes may be harder or easier to see depending on skin color.
Restlessness or irritability.
Rapid breathing.
Poor eating.

Some people with an extra electrical pathway don't have symptoms of a fast heartbeat. This condition is called Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) pattern. It's often discovered by chance during a heart test.
