Calluses


Calluses
Calluses often develop on the palms of the hands. They can vary in size and shape and are rarely painful. Playing instruments or using hand tools can cause calluses on the hands.





Signs and symptoms of corns and calluses include:

A thick, rough area of skin
A hardened, raised bump
Tenderness or pain under the skin
Flaky, dry or waxy skin

Corns and calluses are not the same thing.

Corns are smaller and deeper than calluses and have a hard center surrounded by swollen skin. They can be painful when pressed. Hard corns often form on the top of the toes or the outer edge of the small toe. Soft corns tend to form between the toes.
Calluses are rarely painful and tend to develop on pressure spots, such as the heels, the balls of the feet, the palms and the knees. They may vary in size and shape and are often larger than corns.
