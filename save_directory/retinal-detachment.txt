Retinal detachment itself is painless. But warning signs almost always appear before it occurs or has advanced, such as:

The sudden appearance of many floaters â€” tiny specks that seem to drift through your field of vision
Flashes of light in one or both eyes (photopsia)
Blurred vision
Gradually reduced side (peripheral) vision
A curtain-like shadow over your field of vision
