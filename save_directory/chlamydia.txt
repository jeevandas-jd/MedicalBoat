Early-stage Chlamydia trachomatis infections often cause few symptoms. Even when symptoms occur, they're often mild. That makes them easy to overlook, which is why regular screening is important.
Symptoms of Chlamydia trachomatis infection can include:

Painful urination.
Vaginal discharge.
Discharge from the penis.
Painful vaginal sex.
Vaginal bleeding between periods and after sex.
Testicular pain.

Depending on a person's sexual activity, Chlamydia trachomatis can infect the eyes, throat or rectum.
Eye infections, called conjunctivitis, cause the inside of the eyelid to be red and irritated. In the throat, an infection may have no symptoms, or a person may have a sore throat. An infection in the rectum may have no symptoms or may cause rectal pain, discharge or bleeding.
