Facial paralysis


Facial paralysis
The nerve that controls facial muscles passes through a narrow corridor of bone on its way to the face. Facial weakness or paralysis may cause one corner of the mouth to droop, and the mouth may not be able to retain saliva on the paralyzed side of the face. The condition also may make it difficult to close the eye on the affected side of the face.





Symptoms of Bell's palsy come on suddenly and may include:

Mild weakness to total paralysis on one side of the face — occurring within hours to days.
Facial droop and trouble making facial expressions, such as closing an eye or smiling.
Drooling.
Pain around the jaw or pain in or behind the ear on the affected side.
Increased sensitivity to sound on the affected side.
Headache.
Loss of taste.
Changes in the amount of tears and saliva produced.

Rarely, Bell's palsy can affect the nerves on both sides of the face.
