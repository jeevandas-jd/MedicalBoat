When it starts, cervical cancer might not cause symptoms. As it grows, cervical cancer might cause signs and symptoms, such as: 

Vaginal bleeding after intercourse, between periods or after menopause.
Menstrual bleeding that is heavier and lasts longer than usual.
Watery, bloody vaginal discharge that may be heavy and have a foul odor.
Pelvic pain or pain during intercourse.
