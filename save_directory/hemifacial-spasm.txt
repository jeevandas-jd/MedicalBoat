Common symptoms of hemifacial spasm include jerking of muscles in the face that are most often:

On one side of the face.
Not controllable.
Painless.

These muscle movements, also called contractions, often start in the eyelid. Then they might move on to the cheek and mouth on the same side of the face. At first, hemifacial spasms come and go. But over months to years, they occur almost all the time.
Sometimes, hemifacial spasms occur on both sides of the face. However, the twitching doesn't occur on both sides of the face at the same time.
