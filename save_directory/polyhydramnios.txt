Polyhydramnios symptoms may be linked with the buildup of amniotic fluid creating pressure within the uterus and on nearby organs. Mild polyhydramnios often causes few or no symptoms. But serious forms of the condition may cause:

Shortness of breath or not being able to breathe.
Swelling in the ankles or feet.
Pain in the stomach area.
Feelings of tightness in the muscles of the uterus, called contractions.

Your health care professional also may also suspect polyhydramnios if your uterus has become large for the number of weeks of pregnancy.
