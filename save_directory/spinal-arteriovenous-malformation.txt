Symptoms of a spinal arteriovenous malformation (AVM) can differ from person to person. Symptoms depend on where the AVM is found and how serious it is. Some people may not notice symptoms for many years, if at all. Others may experience symptoms that are life-threatening.
Symptoms often begin when people are in their 20s but can occur at earlier or later ages. Some people are diagnosed under the age of 16.
Symptoms may start suddenly or slowly and may include:

Trouble walking or climbing stairs.
Numbness, tingling or sudden pain in the legs.
Weakness on one or both sides of the body.

As the condition gets worse, you may have more symptoms including:

Sudden, serious back pain.
Lack of feeling in the legs.
Trouble urinating or having bowel movements.
Headache.
Stiff neck.
