Signs and symptoms of osteomyelitis include:

Fever
Swelling, warmth and redness over the area of the infection
Pain in the area of the infection
Fatigue

Sometimes osteomyelitis causes no signs and symptoms or the signs and symptoms are hard to distinguish from other problems. This may be especially true for infants, older adults and people whose immune systems are compromised.
