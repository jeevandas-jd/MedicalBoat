Signs and symptoms of hemophilia vary, depending on your level of clotting factors. If your clotting-factor level is mildly reduced, you might bleed only after surgery or trauma. If your deficiency is severe, you can bleed easily for seemingly no reason.
Signs and symptoms of spontaneous bleeding include:

Unexplained and excessive bleeding from cuts or injuries, or after surgery or dental work
Many large or deep bruises
Unusual bleeding after vaccinations
Pain, swelling or tightness in your joints
Blood in your urine or stool
Nosebleeds without a known cause
In infants, unexplained irritability

Bleeding into the brainA simple bump on the head can cause bleeding into the brain for some people who have severe hemophilia. This rarely happens, but it's one of the most serious complications that can occur. Signs and symptoms include:

Painful, prolonged headache
Repeated vomiting
Sleepiness or lethargy
Double vision
Sudden weakness or clumsiness
Convulsions or seizures
