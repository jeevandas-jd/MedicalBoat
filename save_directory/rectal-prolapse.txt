If you have rectal prolapse, you may notice a reddish lump that comes out of the anus, often while straining during a bowel movement. The lump may slip back inside the anus, or it may continue to be seen.
Other symptoms may include:

You cannot control your bowel movements, known as fecal incontinence.
Constipation or loose stools.
Leaking blood or mucus from the rectum.
Feeling that your rectum isn't empty after a bowel movement.
