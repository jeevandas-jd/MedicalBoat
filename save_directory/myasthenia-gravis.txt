Muscle weakness caused by myasthenia gravis gets worse when the affected muscle is used. Because symptoms usually get better with rest, muscle weakness can come and go. However, the symptoms tend to progress over time. They usually reach their worst within a few years after the disease begins.
Myasthenia gravis may affect any of the muscles that you can control. Certain muscle groups are more commonly affected than others.
Eye musclesIn more than half the people who develop myasthenia gravis, their first symptoms affect the eyes. Symptoms include:

Drooping of one or both eyelids, called ptosis.
Double vision, called diplopia, which may be horizontal or vertical, and improves or resolves when one eye is closed.

Face and throat musclesIn about 15% of people with myasthenia gravis, the first symptoms involve face and throat muscles. These symptoms can:

Make speaking difficult. Your speech might sound soft or nasal, depending on which muscles are affected.
Cause problems with swallowing. You might choke easily, making it difficult to eat, drink or take pills. Sometimes, liquids you're trying to swallow come out your nose.
Affect chewing. The muscles used for chewing might tire halfway through a meal. This is especially true if you've been eating something hard to chew, such as steak.
Change facial expressions. For example, your smile might look like a snarl.

Neck and limb musclesMyasthenia gravis also can cause weakness in the neck, arms and legs. Weakness in the legs can affect how you walk. Weak neck muscles make it hard to hold up the head.
