An enlarged tongue (macroglossia) can be a sign of amyloidosis. It can sometimes also appear rippled along its edge.





You may not experience symptoms of amyloidosis until later in the course of the disease. Symptoms may vary, depending on which organs are affected.
Signs and symptoms of amyloidosis may include:

Severe fatigue and weakness
Shortness of breath
Numbness, tingling, or pain in the hands or feet
Swelling of the ankles and legs
Diarrhea, possibly with blood, or constipation
An enlarged tongue, which sometimes looks rippled around its edge
Skin changes, such as thickening or easy bruising, and purplish patches around the eyes
