Polymorphous light eruption on the chest


Polymorphous light eruption on the chest
Polymorphous light eruption is a rash that affects parts of the body that are exposed to more sunlight as daylight hours get longer, such as the front of the neck and chest. Polymorphous means that the rash can have many forms, such as tiny bumps, raised areas or blisters.





How skin with sun allergy looks varies widely depending on the color of your skin and what's causing the symptoms. Signs and symptoms may include:

Itchiness (pruritus)
Stinging
Tiny bumps that may merge into raised patches
A flushing of the exposed area
Blisters or hives

Symptoms usually occur only on skin that has been exposed to the sun or other source of UV light. Symptoms show up within minutes to hours after sun exposure.
