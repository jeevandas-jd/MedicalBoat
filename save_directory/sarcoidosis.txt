Signs and symptoms of sarcoidosis vary depending on which organs are affected. Sarcoidosis sometimes develops gradually and produces symptoms that last for years. Other times, symptoms appear suddenly and then disappear just as quickly. Many people with sarcoidosis have no symptoms, so the disease may be discovered only when a chest X-ray is done for another reason.
General symptomsSarcoidosis can begin with these signs and symptoms:

Fatigue
Swollen lymph nodes
Weight loss
Pain and swelling in joints, such as the ankles

Lung symptomsSarcoidosis most often affects the lungs and may cause lung problems, such as:

Persistent dry cough
Shortness of breath
Wheezing
Chest pain

Skin symptomsSarcoidosis may cause skin problems, which may include:

A rash of red or reddish-purple bumps, usually located on the shins or ankles, which may be warm and tender to the touch
Disfiguring sores (lesions) on the nose, cheeks and ears
Areas of skin that are darker or lighter in color
Growths under the skin (nodules), particularly around scars or tattoos

Eye symptomsSarcoidosis can affect the eyes without causing any symptoms, so it's important to have your eyes checked regularly. When eye signs and symptoms do occur, they may include:

Blurred vision
Eye pain
Burning, itching or dry eyes
Severe redness
Sensitivity to light

Heart symptomsSigns and symptoms related to cardiac sarcoidosis may include:

Chest pain
Shortness of breath (dyspnea)
Fainting (syncope)
Fatigue
Irregular heartbeats (arrhythmias)
Rapid or fluttering heart beat (palpitations)
Swelling caused by excess fluid (edema)

Sarcoidosis can also affect calcium metabolism, the nervous system, the liver and spleen, muscles, bones and joints, the kidneys, lymph nodes, or any other organ.
