If you're allergic to latex, you're likely to have symptoms after touching latex rubber products, such as gloves or balloons. You also can have symptoms if you breathe in latex particles that are released into the air when someone removes latex gloves.
Latex allergy symptoms range from mild to severe. A reaction depends on how sensitive you are to latex and the amount of latex you touch or inhale. Your reaction can become worse with each additional latex exposure.
Mild symptomsMild latex allergy symptoms include:

Itching
Skin redness
Hives or rash

More-severe symptomsThese include:

Sneezing
Runny nose
Itchy, watery eyes
Scratchy throat
Difficulty breathing
Wheezing
Cough

Life-threatening symptoms: AnaphylaxisThe most serious allergic reaction to latex is anaphylaxis, which can be deadly. An anaphylactic (an-uh-fuh-LAK-tik) reaction develops immediately after latex exposure in highly sensitive people. However, it rarely happens the first time you're exposed.
Symptoms of anaphylaxis include:

Difficulty breathing
Hives or swelling
Nausea and vomiting
Wheezing
Drop in blood pressure
Dizziness
Loss of consciousness
Confusion
Rapid or weak pulse
