Longer arms in Marfan syndrome
Marfan syndrome is a genetic disorder that causes people to have unusually long arms, legs and fingers. Your doctor may want to measure your arm span if he or she thinks you might have the disorder.





The signs and symptoms of Marfan syndrome can vary greatly, even among members of the same family, because the disorder can affect so many different areas of the body. Some people experience only mild effects, but others develop life-threatening complications.
Marfan syndrome features may include:

Tall and slender build
Disproportionately long arms, legs and fingers
A breastbone that protrudes outward or dips inward
A high, arched palate and crowded teeth
Heart murmurs
Extreme nearsightedness
An abnormally curved spine
Flat feet
