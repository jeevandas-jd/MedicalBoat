Typical COVID-19 symptoms often show up 2 to 14 days after contact with the virus.
Symptoms can include:

Dry cough.
Shortness of breath.
Loss of taste or smell.
Extreme tiredness, called fatigue.
Digestive symptoms such as upset stomach, vomiting or loose stools, called diarrhea.
Pain, such as headaches and body or muscle aches.
Fever or chills.
Cold-like symptoms such as congestion, runny nose or sore throat.

People may only have a few symptoms or none. People who have no symptoms but test positive for COVID-19 are called asymptomatic. For example, many children who test positive don't have symptoms of COVID-19 illness. People who go on to have symptoms are considered presymptomatic. Both groups can still spread COVID-19 to others.
Some people may have symptoms that get worse about 7 to 14 days after symptoms start.
Most people with COVID-19 have mild to moderate symptoms. But COVID-19 can cause serious medical complications and lead to death. Older adults or people who already have medical conditions are at greater risk of serious illness.
COVID-19 may be a mild, moderate, severe or critical illness.

In broad terms, mild COVID-19 doesn't affect the ability of the lungs to get oxygen to the body.
In moderate COVID-19 illness, the lungs also work properly but there are signs that the infection is deep in the lungs.
Severe COVID-19 means that the lungs don't work correctly, and the person needs oxygen and other medical help in the hospital.
Critical COVID-19 illness means the lung and breathing system, called the respiratory system, has failed and there is damage throughout the body.

Rarely, people who catch the coronavirus can develop a group of symptoms linked to inflamed organs or tissues. The illness is called multisystem inflammatory syndrome. When children have this illness, it is called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, shortened to MIS-C. In adults, the name is MIS-A.
