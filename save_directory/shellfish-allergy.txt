AnaphylaxisAllergies can cause a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis. It can occur within seconds to minutes after exposure to something you're allergic to â€” and worsens quickly.
An anaphylactic reaction to shellfish is a medical emergency. Anaphylaxis requires immediate treatment with an epinephrine (adrenaline) injection and a follow-up trip to the emergency room. If anaphylaxis isn't treated right away, it can be fatal.
Anaphylaxis causes the immune system to release a flood of chemicals that can cause you to go into shock. Signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis include:

A swollen throat or tongue or a tightness in the throat (airway constriction) that makes it difficult for you to breathe
Coughing, choking or wheezing with trouble breathing
Shock, with a severe drop in your blood pressure and a rapid or weak pulse
Severe skin rash, hives, itching or swelling
Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea
Dizziness, lightheadedness or fainting
