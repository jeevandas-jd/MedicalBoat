Some people with cardiomyopathy don't ever get symptoms. For others, symptoms appear as the condition becomes worse. Cardiomyopathy symptoms can include:

Shortness of breath or trouble breathing with activity or even at rest.
Chest pain, especially after physical activity or heavy meals.
Heartbeats that feel rapid, pounding or fluttering.
Swelling of the legs, ankles, feet, stomach area and neck veins.
Bloating of the stomach area due to fluid buildup.
Cough while lying down.
Trouble lying flat to sleep.
Fatigue, even after getting rest.
Dizziness.
Fainting.

Symptoms tend to get worse unless they are treated. In some people, the condition becomes worse quickly. In others, it might not become worse for a long time.
