Chest pain is the most common symptom of pericarditis. It usually feels sharp or stabbing. But some people have dull, achy or pressure-like chest pain.
Most often, pericarditis pain is felt behind the breastbone or on the left side of the chest. The pain may:

Spread to the left shoulder and neck, or to both shoulders.
Get worse when coughing, lying down or taking a deep breath.
Get better when sitting up or leaning forward.

Other symptoms of pericarditis can include:

Cough.
Fatigue or general feeling of weakness or being sick.
Swelling of the legs or feet.
Low-grade fever.
Pounding or racing heartbeat, also called heart palpitations.
Shortness of breath when lying down.
Swelling of the belly, also called the abdomen.

The specific symptoms depend on the type of pericarditis. Pericarditis is grouped into different categories, according to the pattern of symptoms and how long symptoms last.

Acute pericarditis begins suddenly but doesn't last longer than four weeks. Future episodes can occur. It may be hard to tell the difference between acute pericarditis and pain due to a heart attack.
Recurrent pericarditis occurs about 4 to 6 weeks after a bout of acute pericarditis. No symptoms happen in between.
Incessant pericarditis lasts about 4 to 6 weeks but less than three months. The symptoms continue over this whole time.
Chronic constrictive pericarditis usually develops slowly and lasts longer than three months.
