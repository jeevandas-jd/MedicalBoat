Symptoms of coarctation of the aorta depend on how much of the aorta is narrowed. Most people don't have symptoms.
Adults and older children with mild coarctation of the aorta may not have symptoms and their hearts may seem healthy.
If a baby is born with an extreme narrowing of the aorta, symptoms may be noticed shortly after birth. Symptoms of coarctation of the aorta in infants include:

Difficulty breathing.
Difficulty feeding.
Heavy sweating.
Irritability.
Changes in skin color.

Symptoms of coarctation of the aorta later in life may include:

Chest pain.
High blood pressure.
Headaches.
Muscle weakness.
Leg cramps.
Cold feet.
Nosebleeds.

Coarctation of the aorta often occurs with other heart conditions present at birth. Other symptoms depend on the specific types of congenital heart defects.
