Bedbug bites


Bedbug bites
It can be difficult to tell bedbug bites from other types of insect bites. However, they are typically itchy, and they may appear clustered or lined up in rough rows.





Symptoms of bedbug bites are similar to symptoms of other insect bites and rashes. Bedbug bites are usually: 

Inflamed spots, often with a darker spot in the middle
Itchy
Arranged in a rough line or in a cluster
Located on the face, neck, arms and hands

Some people have no reaction to bedbug bites, while others experience an allergic reaction that can include severe itching, blisters or hives.
