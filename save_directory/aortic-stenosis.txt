Aortic valve stenosis ranges from mild to severe. Symptoms generally occur when narrowing of the valve is severe. Some people with aortic valve stenosis may not have symptoms for many years.
Symptoms of aortic valve stenosis may include:

An irregular heart sound (heart murmur) heard through a stethoscope
Chest pain (angina) or tightness with activity
Feeling faint or dizzy or fainting with activity
Shortness of breath, especially with activity
Fatigue, especially during times of increased activity
Rapid, fluttering heartbeat (palpitations)
Not eating enough (mainly in children with aortic valve stenosis)
Not gaining enough weight (mainly in children with aortic valve stenosis)

Aortic valve stenosis may lead to heart failure. Heart failure symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, and swollen ankles and feet.
