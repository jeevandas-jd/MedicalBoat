IgA nephropathy often doesn't cause symptoms early on. You might not notice any health effects for 10 years or more. Sometimes, routine medical tests find signs of the disease, such as protein and red blood cells in the urine that are seen under a microscope.
When IgA nephropathy causes symptoms, they might include:

Cola- or tea-colored urine caused by blood. You might notice these color changes after a cold, sore throat or respiratory infection.
Blood that can be seen in the urine.
Foamy urine from protein leaking into the urine. This is called proteinuria.
Pain on one or both sides of the back below the ribs.
Swelling in the hands and feet called edema.
High blood pressure.
Weakness and tiredness.

If the disease leads to kidney failure, symptoms may include:

Rashes and itchy skin.
Muscle cramps.
Upset stomach and vomiting.
Less appetite.
Metallic taste in the mouth.
Confusion.

Kidney failure is life-threatening without treatment. But dialysis or a kidney transplant can help people live for many more years.
