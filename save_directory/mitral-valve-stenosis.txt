Mitral valve stenosis usually worsens slowly. You may not have any symptoms, or you may have mild ones for many years. Symptoms of mitral valve stenosis can occur at any age, even during childhood.
Symptoms of mitral valve stenosis include:

Shortness of breath, especially with activity or when you lie down.
Fatigue, especially during increased activity.
Swollen feet or legs.
Pounding, skipping or otherwise irregular heartbeats, called arrhythmias.
Dizziness or fainting.
Fluid buildup in the lungs.
Chest discomfort or chest pain.
Coughing up blood.

Mitral valve stenosis symptoms may appear or get worse when the heart rate increases, such as during exercise. Anything that puts stress on the body, including pregnancy or infections, may trigger symptoms.
