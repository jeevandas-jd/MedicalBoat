The symptoms of acute coronary syndrome usually begin suddenly. They include:

Chest pain or discomfort. This is often described as aching, pressure, tightness or burning. Chest pain also is called angina.
Pain that starts in the chest and spreads to other parts of the body. These areas include the shoulders, arms, upper belly area, back, neck or jaw.
Nausea or vomiting.
Indigestion.
Shortness of breath, also called dyspnea.
Sudden, heavy sweating.
Racing heartbeat.
Feeling lightheaded or dizzy.
Fainting.
Unusual fatigue.

Chest pain or discomfort is the most common symptom. But symptoms may vary quite a bit depending on your age, sex and other medical conditions. You're more likely to have symptoms without chest pain or discomfort if you're a woman, an older adult or have diabetes.
