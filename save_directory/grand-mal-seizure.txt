Tonic-clonic seizures have two stages:

Tonic phase. Loss of consciousness occurs. The muscles suddenly contract and cause the person to fall down. This phase tends to last about 10 to 20 seconds.
Clonic phase. The muscles go into rhythmic contractions. They alternately flex and relax. Convulsions usually last 1 to 2 minutes or less.

The following symptoms occur in some but not all people with tonic-clonic seizures:

A scream. Some people may cry out at the beginning of a seizure.
Loss of bowel and bladder control. This may happen during or following a seizure.
Not responding after convulsions. The person may not become conscious for several minutes after convulsions have ended.
Confusion. The person often is disoriented after a tonic-clonic seizure. This is referred to as postictal confusion.
Fatigue. Sleepiness is common after a tonic-clonic seizure.
Bad headache. Headaches may occur after a tonic-clonic seizure.
