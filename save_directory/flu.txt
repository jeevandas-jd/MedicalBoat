At first, the flu may seem like a cold with a runny nose, sneezing and sore throat. Colds usually start slowly. But the flu tends to come on quickly. And while a cold can be miserable, you usually feel much worse with the flu.
Common symptoms of the flu often — but not always — include a fever as well as aching muscles, chills and sweats.
Other symptoms include:

Headache.
Dry, persistent cough.
Shortness of breath.
Tiredness and weakness.
Runny or stuffy nose.
Sore throat.
Eye pain.

Vomiting and diarrhea also are flu symptoms. But they are more common in children than in adults.
