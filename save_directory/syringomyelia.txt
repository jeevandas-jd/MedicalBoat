Syringomyelia symptoms usually develop slowly over time. If syringomyelia is caused by brain tissue pushing into the spinal canal, it is called a Chiari malformation. Symptoms generally begin between ages 25 and 40.
In some cases, coughing or straining can trigger symptoms of syringomyelia, although neither causes syringomyelia.
Syringomyelia might affect the back, shoulders, arms or legs. Symptoms can include:

Muscle weakness and muscle wasting.
Loss of reflexes.
Loss of sensitivity to pain and temperature.
Headaches.
Stiffness in the back, shoulders, arms and legs.
Pain in the neck, arms and back.
Scoliosis. This is when the spine curves sideways.
