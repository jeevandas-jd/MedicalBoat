In hypospadias, the opening of the urethra is on the underside of the penis instead of at the tip. In most cases, the opening of the urethra is within the head of the penis. Less often, the opening is at the middle or the base of the penis. Rarely, the opening is in or beneath the scrotum.
Symptoms of hypospadias may include:

Opening of the urethra at a place other than the tip of the penis.
Downward curve of the penis. This condition is called chordee.
Hooded appearance of the penis because only the top half of the penis is covered by foreskin.
Differences in spraying when passing urine.
