Symptoms of eye floaters may include:

Small shapes in your vision that appear as dark specks or knobby, transparent strings of floating material
Spots that move when you move your eyes, so when you try to look at them, they move quickly out of your line of vision
Spots that are most noticeable when you look at a plain bright background, such as a blue sky or a white wall
Small shapes or strings that eventually settle down and drift out of the line of vision
