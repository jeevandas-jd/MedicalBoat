Urinary tract infections commonly occur in people with vesicoureteral reflux. A urinary tract infection (UTI) doesn't always cause noticeable signs and symptoms, though most people have some.
These signs and symptoms can include:

A strong, persistent urge to urinate
A burning sensation when urinating
The need to pass small amounts of urine frequently
Cloudy urine
Fever
Pain in your side (flank) or abdomen

A UTI may be difficult to diagnose in children, who may have only nonspecific signs and symptoms. Signs and symptoms in infants with a UTI may also include:

An unexplained fever
Lack of appetite
Irritability

As your child gets older, untreated vesicoureteral reflux can lead to:

Bed-wetting
Constipation or loss of control over bowel movements 
High blood pressure
Protein in urine

Another indication of vesicoureteral reflux, which may be detected before birth by sonogram, is swelling of the kidneys or the urine-collecting structures of one or both kidneys (hydronephrosis) in the fetus, caused by the backup of urine into the kidneys.
