The symptoms of hemolytic uremic syndrome vary, depending on the cause. The first symptoms of hemolytic uremic syndrome caused by E. coli bacteria might include:

Diarrhea, which is often bloody.
Pain, cramping or bloating in the stomach area.
Fever.
Vomiting.

All forms of hemolytic uremic syndrome damage blood vessels. This damage causes red blood cells to break down, called anemia. The condition also causes blood clots to form in the blood vessels and, in turn, damage the kidneys.
Symptoms of these changes include:

Loss of color in the skin.
Extreme tiredness.
Easy bruising.
Unusual bleeding, such as bleeding from the nose and mouth.
Decreased urinating or blood in the urine.
Swelling, called edema, of the legs, feet or ankles. Swelling occurs less often in the face, hands, feet or entire body.
Confusion, seizures or stroke.
High blood pressure.
