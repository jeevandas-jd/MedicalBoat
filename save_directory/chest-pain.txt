Chest pain can feel different depending on what's triggering the symptom. Often, the cause has nothing to do with the heart — though there's no easy way to tell without seeing a health care provider.
Heart-related chest painChest pain is often associated with heart disease. But many people with heart disease say they have a mild discomfort that they wouldn't really call pain. Chest discomfort due to a heart attack or another heart problem may feel like:

Pressure, fullness, burning or tightness in the chest.
Crushing or searing pain that spreads to the back, neck, jaw, shoulders, and one or both arms.
Pain that lasts more than a few minutes, gets worse with activity, goes away and comes back, or varies in intensity.
Shortness of breath.
Cold sweats.
Dizziness, lightheadedness or weakness.
Racing heartbeats.
Nausea or vomiting.

Other types of chest painIt can be difficult to tell if chest pain is related to the heart or caused by something else. Usually, chest pain is less likely due to a heart problem if it happens with:

A sour taste or a sensation of food reentering the mouth
Trouble swallowing
Pain that gets better or worse when you change body position
Pain that gets worse when you breathe deeply or cough
Tenderness when you push on your chest
Pain that continues for many hours

The classic symptoms of heartburn — a painful, burning sensation behind the breastbone — can be caused by problems with the heart or the stomach.
