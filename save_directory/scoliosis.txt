Symptoms of scoliosis may include:

Uneven shoulders.
One shoulder blade that appears more prominent than the other.
Uneven waist.
One hip higher than the other.
One side of the rib cage jutting forward.
A prominence on one side of the back when bending forward.

With most scoliosis cases, the spine will rotate or twist in addition to curving side to side. This causes the ribs or muscles on one side of the body to stick out farther than those on the other side.
