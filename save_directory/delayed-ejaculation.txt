There's no set time that means a diagnosis of delayed ejaculation. Some people with delayed ejaculation need many minutes of sexual stimulation to have an orgasm and ejaculate. Others might not be able to ejaculate at all, called anejaculation.
In delayed ejaculation, the delay causes upset. Also delayed ejaculation might mean stopping sex due to tiredness, physical irritation, loss of erection or because the partner wants to stop.
Often, there's trouble reaching orgasm during sexual intercourse or other sexual activities with a partner. Some people can ejaculate only when masturbating. But others may not be able to ejaculate by masturbating.
Delayed ejaculation is divided into the following types based on symptoms:

Lifelong versus acquired. With lifelong delayed ejaculation, the problem is present from the time of sexual maturity. Acquired delayed ejaculation happens after a period of typical sexual functioning.
Generalized versus situational. Generalized delayed ejaculation isn't limited to certain sex partners or certain kinds of arousal. Situational delayed ejaculation happens only under certain conditions.
