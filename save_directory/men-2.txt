Multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 2B (MEN 2B)


Multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 2B (MEN 2B)
People with MEN 2B have tumors of nerves in the lips, mouth, eyes and digestive tract. They also may have a tumor on the adrenal gland, called pheochromocytoma, and medullary thyroid cancer.





Symptoms of MEN 2 depend on the type of tumor. People who have MEN 2B have a unique appearance. They may have bumps on the tongue, lips and eyes. They tend to be tall and thin with long arms and legs. Following are symptoms that may be related to each tumor type.
Medullary thyroid cancer:

Lumps in the throat or neck
Trouble breathing or swallowing
Hoarseness
Diarrhea

Parathyroid hyperplasia, also known as primary hyperparathyroidism:

Muscle and joint pain
Constipation
Fatigue
Memory problems
Kidney stones

Adrenal tumors, also known as pheochromocytoma:

High blood pressure
Rapid heart rate
Anxiety
Headaches

Symptoms may be caused by a thyroid tumor pressing on tissues around it or by the release of too many hormones in the body. Some people who have medullary thyroid cancer may have no symptoms.
