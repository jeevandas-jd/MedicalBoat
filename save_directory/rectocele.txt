A small posterior vaginal prolapse (rectocele) might cause no symptoms.
Otherwise, you may notice:

A soft bulge of tissue in the vagina that might come through the opening of the vagina
Trouble having a bowel movement
Feeling pressure or fullness in the rectum
A feeling that the rectum has not completely emptied after a bowel movement
Sexual concerns, such as feeling embarrassed or sensing looseness in the tone of the vaginal tissue

Many women with posterior vaginal prolapse also have prolapse of other pelvic organs, such as the bladder or uterus. A surgeon can evaluate the prolapse and talk about options for surgery to fix it.
