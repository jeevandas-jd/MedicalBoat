Typically, there's no outward sign of this condition, such as a lump. Instead, you may experience the following symptoms:

A feeling as if you're standing on a pebble in your shoe
A burning pain in the ball of your foot that may radiate into your toes
Tingling or numbness in your toes

In addition to these symptoms, you may find that removing your shoe and rubbing your foot often helps to relieve the pain.
