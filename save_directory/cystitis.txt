Cystitis signs and symptoms may include:

A strong, persistent urge to urinate
Pain or a burning feeling when urinating
Passing frequent, small amounts of urine
Blood in the urine (hematuria)
Passing cloudy or strong-smelling urine
Pelvic discomfort
A feeling of pressure in the area below your belly button (abdomen)
Low-grade fever

In young children, new episodes of accidental daytime wetting also may be a sign of a urinary tract infection (UTI). Nighttime bed-wetting on its own isn't likely to happen because of a UTI.
