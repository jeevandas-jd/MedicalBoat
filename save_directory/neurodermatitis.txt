Symptoms of neurodermatitis include:

An itchy, scaly skin patch or patches
Open sores that bleed
Thick, leathery skin
Discolored, wrinkled genital skin
Raised, rough patches that are inflamed or darker than the rest of the skin

The condition involves areas that can be reached for scratching â€” the scalp, neck, wrists, forearms, ankles, vulva, scrotum and anus. The itchiness, which can be intense, may come and go or be nonstop. You may scratch your skin out of habit and while sleeping.
