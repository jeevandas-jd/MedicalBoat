Signs and symptoms of a poison ivy rash include:

Redness
Itching
Swelling
Blisters
Difficulty breathing, if you've inhaled the smoke from burning poison ivy

Poison ivy rash often appears in a straight line because of the way the plant brushes against your skin. But if you develop a rash after touching a piece of clothing or pet fur that has urushiol on it, the rash may be more spread out. You can also transfer the oil to other parts of your body with your fingers. The reaction usually develops 12 to 48 hours after exposure and lasts two to three weeks.
The severity of the rash depends on the amount of urushiol that gets on your skin.
