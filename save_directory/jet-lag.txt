Symptoms of jet lag can vary. You may experience only one symptom or you may have many. Jet lag symptoms may include:

Sleep problems such as not being able to fall asleep or waking up early.
Daytime fatigue.
Not being able to focus or function at your usual level.
Stomach problems such as constipation or diarrhea.
A general feeling of not being well.
Mood changes.

Symptoms are worse the farther you travelJet lag symptoms usually occur within a day or two after traveling across at least two time zones. Symptoms are likely to be worse or last longer the farther you travel. This is especially true if you fly east. It usually takes about a day to recover for each time zone crossed.
