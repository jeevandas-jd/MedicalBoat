Epidermolysis bullosa symptoms include:

Fragile skin that blisters easily, especially on the palms and feet
Nails that are thick or unformed
Blisters inside the mouth and throat
Scalp blistering and hair loss (scarring alopecia)
Skin that looks thin
Tiny pimple-like bumps (milia)
Dental problems, such as tooth decay
Difficulty swallowing
Itchy, painful skin

Usually epidermolysis bullosa blisters are noticed during infancy. But it's not uncommon for them to appear when a toddler first begins to walk or when an older child begins new activities that cause more friction on the soles of the feet.
