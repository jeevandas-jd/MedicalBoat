Sunburn symptoms can include:

Inflamed skin, which looks pink or red on white skin and may be harder to see on brown or Black skin.
Skin that feels warm or hot to the touch.
Pain, tenderness and itching.
Swelling.
Small, fluid-filled blisters, which may break.
Headache, fever, nausea and fatigue, if the sunburn is severe.
Eyes that feel painful or gritty.

Any exposed part of the body — including the earlobes, scalp and lips — can burn. Even covered areas can burn if, for example, clothing has a loose weave that allows ultraviolet (UV) light through. The eyes, which are extremely sensitive to the sun's UV light, also can burn.
Sunburn symptoms often appear within a few hours after sun exposure.
Within a few days, the body may start to heal itself by peeling the damaged skin's top layer. A bad sunburn may take several days to heal. Any lingering changes in skin color usually go away with time.
