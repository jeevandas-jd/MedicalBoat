At first, invasive lobular carcinoma may cause no signs and symptoms. As it grows larger, invasive lobular carcinoma may cause:

A change in the texture or appearance of the skin over the breast, such as dimpling or thickening.
A new area of fullness or swelling in the breast.
A newly inverted nipple.
An area of thickening in part of the breast.

Invasive lobular carcinoma is less likely to cause a firm or distinct breast lump than other types of breast cancer.
