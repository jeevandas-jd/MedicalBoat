Rectal cancer may not cause symptoms early on. Symptoms of rectal cancer usually happen when the disease is advanced.
Signs and symptoms of rectal cancer include:

A change in bowel habits, such as diarrhea, constipation or a more-frequent need to pass stool.
A feeling that the bowel doesn't empty completely.
Abdominal pain.
Dark maroon or bright red blood in stool.
Narrow stool.
Weight loss that happens without trying.
Weakness or fatigue.
