Smallpox


Smallpox
These are smallpox sores on the skin. This photograph was taken in Bangladesh in 1974.





The first symptoms of smallpox usually appear 12 to 14 days after you're exposed to the smallpox virus. However, the virus can be in your body from 7 to 19 days before you look or feel sick. This time is called the incubation period.
After the incubation period, sudden flu-like symptoms occur. These include:

Fever
Muscle aches
Headache
Severe fatigue
Severe back pain
Vomiting, sometimes

A few days later, flat, red spots appear on the body. They may start in the mouth and on the tongue and then spread to the skin. The face, arms and legs are often affected first, followed by the torso, hands and feet.
Within a day or two, many of the spots turn into small blisters filled with clear fluid. Later, the blisters fill with pus. These sores are called pustules. Scabs form 8 to 9 days later and eventually fall off, leaving deep, pitted scars.
Smallpox can be spread from person to person when the rash appears and until the scabs fall off.
