Some babies born with Ebstein anomaly have few or no symptoms. Others have a tricuspid valve that leaks severely and causes more-noticeable problems. Sometimes symptoms don't occur until later in life.
Symptoms of Ebstein anomaly may include:

Blue or gray lips or fingernails. Depending on skin color, these color changes may be harder or easier to see.
Fatigue.
Feeling of a pounding or rapid heartbeat or irregular heartbeats.
Shortness of breath, especially with activity.
