A specific phobia involves a strong, lasting fear of a certain object or situation that's much greater than the actual risk. There are many types of phobias. It's common to have a specific phobia about more than one object or situation. Specific phobias also can happen along with other types of anxiety disorders.
Common types of specific phobias are fears of:

Situations, such as airplanes, driving, enclosed spaces or going to school.
Nature, such as thunderstorms, heights or the dark.
Animals or insects, such as dogs, snakes or spiders.
Blood, shots or injuries, such as needles, accidents or medical procedures.
Others, such as choking, throwing up, loud noises or clowns.

Each specific phobia has a name. Phobia comes from the Greek word "phobos," which means fear. Examples of more common names include acrophobia for the fear of heights and claustrophobia for the fear of confined spaces.
No matter what specific phobia you have, you may:

Feel intense fear, anxiety and panic right away when exposed to or even thinking about what causes your fear.
Know that your fears are not reasonable or not as big as you think they are, but you cannot control them.
Have anxiety that gets worse as the situation or object gets closer to you physically or in time.
Do everything possible to stay away from an object or situation or face it with extreme anxiety or fear.
Have trouble with daily activities because of your fear.
Have physical reactions and feelings, including sweating, rapid heartbeat, tight chest or trouble breathing.
Feel like throwing up, or you get dizzy or faint, especially around blood or injuries.

Children may have tantrums, or they may cling, cry or refuse to leave a parent's side or approach their fear.
