Impulsive attacks and angry outbursts occur suddenly, with little or no warning. They usually last less than 30 minutes. These bouts may occur often or be separated by weeks or months. Verbal outbursts or less severe physical attacks may still occur in between these times. You may be irritable, impulsive, aggressive or angry most of the time.
Before an aggressive bout, you may feel:

Rage.
Irritability.
More tension and energy.
Racing thoughts.
Tingling.
Shaking.
Fast or pounding heartbeat.
Chest tightness.

The explosive verbal and behavioral outbursts are much too intense for the situation, with no thought about what might happen as a result. The outbursts can include:

Temper tantrums.
Long, angry speeches.
Heated arguments.
Shouting.
Slapping, shoving or pushing.
Physical fights.
Property damage.
Threatening or harming people or animals.

You may feel a sense of relief and tiredness after the outburst. Later, you may feel guilty, sorry for your actions or embarrassed.
