Patent ductus arteriosus symptoms (PDA) depend on the size of the opening and the person's age. A small PDA might not cause symptoms. Some people don't notice symptoms until adulthood. A large PDA can cause symptoms of heart failure soon after birth.
A large PDA found during infancy or childhood might cause:

Poor eating, which leads to poor growth.
Sweating with crying or eating.
Persistent fast breathing or breathlessness.
Easy tiring.
Rapid heart rate.
