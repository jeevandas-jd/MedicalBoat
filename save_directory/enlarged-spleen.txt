An enlarged spleen typically causes no signs or symptoms, but sometimes it causes:

Pain or fullness in the left upper belly that can spread to the left shoulder
A feeling of fullness without eating or after eating a small amount because the spleen is pressing on your stomach
Low red blood cells (anemia)
Frequent infections
Bleeding easily
