Signs and symptoms of pleurisy might include:

Chest pain that worsens when you breathe, cough or sneeze.
Shortness of breath — often from trying to limit breathing in and out.
Cough — only in some cases.
Fever — only in some cases.

Pain caused by pleurisy might worsen with movement of your upper body and can spread to your shoulders or back.
Pleurisy can occur along with pleural effusion, atelectasis or empyema:

Pleural effusion. In some cases of pleurisy, fluid builds up in the small space between the two layers of tissue. This is called pleural effusion. When there is a fair amount of fluid, pleuritic pain lessens or disappears because the two layers of pleura are no longer in contact and don't rub together.
Atelectasis. A large amount of fluid in the pleural space can create pressure. This can compress your lung to the point that it partially or completely collapses (atelectasis). This makes breathing difficult and might cause coughing.
Empyema. The extra fluid in the pleural space can also become infected, resulting in a buildup of pus. This is called an empyema. Fever often occurs along with an empyema.
