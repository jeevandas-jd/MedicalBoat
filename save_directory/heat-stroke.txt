Heatstroke symptoms include:

High body temperature. A core body temperature of 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius) or higher is the main sign of heatstroke.
Change in mental state or behavior. Confusion, agitation, slurred speech, irritability, delirium, seizures and coma can all result from heatstroke.
Change in sweating pattern. In heatstroke brought on by hot weather, skin feels hot and dry to the touch. However, in heatstroke brought on by strenuous exercise, sweating may be profuse.
Nausea and vomiting. Someone with heatstroke may feel sick to their stomach or vomit.
Flushed skin. Skin may turn red as body temperature increases.
Rapid breathing. Breathing may become rapid and shallow.
Racing heart rate. Pulse may significantly increase because heat stress places an extreme burden on the heart to help cool the body.
Headache. Heatstroke may cause the head to throb.
