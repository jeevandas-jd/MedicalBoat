Vulva


Vulva
The vulva is the outer part of the female genitalia, including the labia majora, labia minora and clitoris.





The main vulvodynia symptom is pain in the vulva, which includes the opening of the vagina. The pain often is described as:

Burning.
Irritation.
Stinging.
Rawness.
Soreness.
Sharp or knife-like pain.

You also may feel aching, throbbing and swelling.
How often the symptoms happen and where exactly they're felt varies from person to person. Your pain might be constant, or it may come and go. It might flare up only when the vulva is touched. You might feel the pain throughout your entire vulva. This is called generalized vulvodynia. Or the pain may flare up in a certain area, such as the tissue surrounding the opening of the vagina, called the vestibule. This is known as localized vulvodynia, and it's more common than the generalized kind.
The tissue of the vulva might look slightly inflamed or swollen. More often, your vulva doesn't look different than usual.
