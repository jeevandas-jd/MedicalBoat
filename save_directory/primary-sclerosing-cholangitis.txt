Primary sclerosing cholangitis is often diagnosed before symptoms appear when a routine blood test or an X-ray taken for an unrelated condition shows liver abnormalities.
Early signs and symptoms often include:

Fatigue
Itching
Yellow eyes and skin (jaundice)
Abdominal pain

Many people diagnosed with primary sclerosing cholangitis before they have symptoms continue to feel generally well for several years. But there's no reliable way to predict how quickly or slowly the disease will progress for any individual.
Signs and symptoms that may appear as the disease progresses include:

Fever
Chills
Night sweats
Enlarged liver
Enlarged spleen
Weight loss
