The symptoms of a peripheral nerve tumor develop from direct effects on the main nerve or from the tumor pressing on nearby nerves, blood vessels or tissues. As the tumor grows, it may be more likely to cause symptoms, although tumor size doesn't always determine effects.
Symptoms of peripheral nerve tumors vary depending on where the tumors are located and the tissues affected. They include:

Swelling or a lump under the skin.
Pain, tingling or numbness.
Weakness or a loss of function in the affected area.
Dizziness or a loss of balance.
