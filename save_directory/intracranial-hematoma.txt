Symptoms of an intracranial hematoma may develop right after a head injury, or they may take weeks or longer to appear. There may be a period of time without symptoms after a head injury. This is called the lucid interval.
Over time, pressure on the brain increases, producing some or all of the following symptoms:

Headache that gets worse.
Vomiting.
Drowsiness and gradual loss of consciousness.
Dizziness.
Confusion.
Pupils that are different sizes.
Slurred speech.
Loss of movement, known as paralysis, on the opposite side of the body from the head injury.
As more blood fills the brain or the narrow space between the brain and skull, other symptoms may appear, such as:

Feeling very sleepy or sluggish.
Seizures.
Loss of consciousness.
