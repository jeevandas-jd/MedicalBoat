With REM sleep behavior disorder, instead of experiencing the normal temporary paralysis of your arms and legs (atonia) during REM sleep, you physically act out your dreams.
The onset can be gradual or sudden, and episodes may occur occasionally or several times a night. The disorder often worsens with time.
Symptoms of REM sleep behavior disorder may include:

Movement, such as kicking, punching, arm flailing or jumping from bed, in response to action-filled or violent dreams, such as being chased or defending yourself from an attack
Noises, such as talking, laughing, shouting, emotional outcries or even cursing
Being able to recall the dream if you awaken during the episode
