Foodborne botulismSymptoms of foodborne botulism typically begin 12 to 36 hours after the toxin gets into your body. But depending on how much toxin you consumed, the start of symptoms may range from a few hours to a few days.
Symptoms of foodborne botulism include:

Trouble swallowing or speaking
Dry mouth
Facial weakness on both sides of the face
Blurred or double vision
Drooping eyelids
Trouble breathing
Nausea, vomiting and stomach cramps
Paralysis

Wound botulismSymptoms of wound botulism appear about 10 days after the toxin enters your body. Wound botulism symptoms include:

Trouble swallowing or speaking
Facial weakness on both sides of the face
Blurred or double vision
Drooping eyelids
Trouble breathing
Paralysis

The area around the wound may not always appear swollen and show a change of color.
Infant botulismProblems generally begin 18 to 36 hours after the toxin enters the baby's body. Symptoms include:

Constipation, which is often the first symptom
Floppy movements due to muscle weakness and trouble controlling the head
Weak cry
Irritability
Drooling
Drooping eyelids
Tiredness
Trouble sucking or feeding
Paralysis

Certain symptoms don't typically occur with botulism. For example, botulism doesn't usually raise blood pressure or heart rate or cause fever or confusion. Sometimes, though, wound botulism may cause fever.
Iatrogenic botulismIn iatrogenic botulism — when the toxin is injected for cosmetic or medical reasons — there have been rare occurrences of serious side effects. These may include headache, facial paralysis, and muscle weakness.
