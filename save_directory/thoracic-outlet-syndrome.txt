There are three types of thoracic outlet syndrome:

Neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome. This is the most common type of thoracic outlet syndrome. In this type, a group of nerves called the brachial plexus is compressed. The nerves of the brachial plexus come from the spinal cord. The nerves control muscle movements and feeling in the shoulder, arm and hand.
Venous thoracic outlet syndrome. This type of thoracic outlet syndrome occurs when one or more of the veins under the collarbone are compressed and damaged. This can result in blood clots.
Arterial thoracic outlet syndrome. This is the least common type of TOS. It occurs when one of the arteries under the collarbone is compressed. The compression may cause injury to the artery resulting in a bulge, known as an aneurysm, or blood clot formation.

Thoracic outlet syndrome symptoms can vary depending on the type. When nerves are compressed, symptoms of neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome include:

Numbness or tingling in the arm or fingers.
Pain or aches in the neck, shoulder, arm or hand.
Arm fatigue with activity.
A weakening grip.

Symptoms of venous thoracic outlet syndrome can include:

A change in the color of the hand or one or more fingers.
Hand or arm pain and swelling.

Symptoms of arterial thoracic outlet syndrome can include:

A pulsating lump near the collarbone.
Cold fingers, hands or arms.
Hand and arm pain.
A change in color in one or more of the fingers or the entire hand.
Weak or no pulse in the affected arm.
