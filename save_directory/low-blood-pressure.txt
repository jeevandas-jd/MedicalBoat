Low blood pressure symptoms can include:

Blurred or fading vision.
Dizzy or lightheaded feelings.
Fainting.
Fatigue.
Trouble concentrating.
Upset stomach.

For some people, low blood pressure may be a symptom of an underlying health condition. That's especially so when blood pressure drops suddenly or when low blood pressure occurs with symptoms.
A sudden fall in blood pressure can be dangerous. A change of just 20 mm Hg can make you feel dizzy or faint. For example, those symptoms could happen after a drop in systolic pressure from 110 mm Hg to 90 mm Hg. And big drops can be life-threatening. These can happen for reasons such as serious bleeding, serious infections or allergic reactions.
Extreme low blood pressure can lead to a condition known as shock. Symptoms of shock include:

Confusion, especially in older people.
Cold, clammy skin.
Decrease in skin color, also called pallor.
Rapid, shallow breathing.
Weak and rapid pulse.
