Some people born with a heart problem don't notice symptoms until later in life. Symptoms also may return years after a congenital heart defect is treated.
Common congenital heart disease symptoms in adults include:

Irregular heartbeats, called arrhythmias.
Blue or gray skin, lips and fingernails due to low oxygen levels. Depending on the skin color, these changes may be harder or easier to see.
Shortness of breath.
Feeling tired very quickly with activity.
Swelling due to fluid collecting inside body tissues, called edema.
