More than half of people with primary biliary cholangitis do not have any noticeable symptoms when diagnosed. The disease may be diagnosed when blood tests are done for other reasons, such as routine testing. Symptoms eventually develop over the next 5 to 20 years. Those who do have symptoms at diagnosis typically have poorer outcomes.
Common early symptoms include:

Fatigue.
Itchy skin.

Later signs and symptoms may include:

Yellowing of the skin and eyes, called jaundice.
Dry eyes and mouth.
Pain in the upper right abdomen.
Swelling of the spleen, called splenomegaly.
Bone, muscle or joint pain.
Swollen feet and ankles.
Buildup of fluid in the abdomen due to liver failure, called ascites.
Fatty deposits, called xanthomas, on the skin around the eyes, eyelids or in the creases of the palms, soles, elbows or knees.
Darkening of the skin that's not related to sun exposure, called hyperpigmentation.
Weak and brittle bones, called osteoporosis, which can lead to fractures.
High cholesterol.
Diarrhea that may include greasy stools, called steatorrhea.
Underactive thyroid, called hypothyroidism.
Weight loss.
