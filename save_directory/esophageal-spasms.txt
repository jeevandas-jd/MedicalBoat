Esophagus


Esophagus
The esophagus is a muscular tube that connects the mouth and the stomach. Rings of muscle called sphincters contract and relax to allow food and liquid to pass.





Symptoms of esophageal spasms include:

Squeezing pain in your chest. The pain is often intense, and you might mistake it for heart pain, also known as angina.
Difficulty swallowing solids and liquids, sometimes related to swallowing specific substances. Red wine or extremely hot or cold liquids are more common culprits.
The feeling that an object is stuck in your throat.
The return of food and liquids back up your esophagus, also called regurgitation.
