The most common sign of alcoholic hepatitis is yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, called jaundice. The yellowing of the skin might be harder to see on Black and brown people.
Other symptoms include:

Loss of appetite.
Nausea and vomiting.
Belly tenderness.
Fever, often low grade.
Tiredness and weakness.

People with alcoholic hepatitis tend to be malnourished. Drinking large amounts of alcohol keeps people from being hungry. And heavy drinkers get most of their calories from alcohol.
Other symptoms that happen with severe alcoholic hepatitis include:

Fluid buildup in the belly, called ascites.
Being confused and acting oddly due to a buildup of toxins. The healthy liver breaks these toxins down and gets rid of them.
Kidney and liver failure.
