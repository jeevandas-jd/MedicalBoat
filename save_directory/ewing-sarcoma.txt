Ewing sarcoma signs and symptoms typically start in and around a bone. This cancer most often affects bones in the legs and the pelvis.
When symptoms happen in and around a bone, they might include:

A lump in the arm, leg, chest or pelvis.
Bone pain.
Break in a bone, also called a fracture.
Pain, swelling or tenderness near the affected area.

Sometimes Ewing sarcoma causes symptoms that affect the whole body. These can include:

Fever. 
Losing weight without trying.
Tiredness.
