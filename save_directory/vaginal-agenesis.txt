Vaginal agenesis often goes unnoticed until females reach their teens, but don't menstruate (amenorrhea). Other signs of puberty usually follow typical female development.
Vaginal agenesis may have these features:

The genitals look like a typical female.
The vagina may be shortened without a cervix at the end, or absent and marked only by a slight indentation where a vaginal opening would typically be located.
There may be no uterus or one that's only partially developed. If there's tissue lining the uterus (endometrium), monthly cramping or chronic abdominal pain may occur.
The ovaries typically are fully developed and functional, but they may be in an unusual location in the abdomen. Sometimes the pair of tubes that eggs travel through to get from the ovaries to the uterus (fallopian tubes) are absent or do not develop typically.

Vaginal agenesis may also be associated with other issues, such as:

Problems with development of the kidneys and urinary tract
Developmental changes in the bones of the spine, ribs and wrists
Hearing problems
Other congenital conditions that also involve the heart, gastrointestinal tract and limb growth
