Most often, aortic valve regurgitation develops over time. You may have no symptoms for years. You might not realize that you have the condition. But sometimes, aortic valve regurgitation occurs suddenly. Usually, this is due to an infection of the valve.
As aortic valve regurgitation becomes worse, symptoms may include:

Shortness of breath with exercise or when lying down.
Tiredness and weakness, especially when being more active than usual.
Irregular heartbeat.
Lightheadedness or fainting.
Pain, discomfort or tightness in the chest, which often gets worse during exercise.
Sensations of a rapid, fluttering heartbeat, called palpitations.
Swollen ankles and feet.
