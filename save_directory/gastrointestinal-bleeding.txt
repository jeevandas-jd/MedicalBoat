Symptoms of GI bleeding can be easy to see, called overt, or not so obvious, known as occult. Symptoms depend on the rate of bleeding as well as the location of the bleed, which can be anywhere on the GI tract, from where it starts — the mouth — to where it ends — the anus.
Overt bleeding might show up as:

Vomiting blood, which might be red or might be dark brown and look like coffee grounds.
Black, tarry stool.
Rectal bleeding, usually in or with stool.

With occult bleeding, you might have:

Lightheadedness.
Difficulty breathing.
Fainting.
Chest pain.
Abdominal pain.

Weakness or fatigue.

A gray or bluish tinge to lips or fingernails.
Changes in mental status or behavior, such as anxiousness or agitation.
