Tetralogy of Fallot symptoms depend on how much blood flow is blocked from leaving the heart to go to the lungs. Symptoms may include:

Blue or gray skin color.
Shortness of breath and rapid breathing, especially during feeding or exercise.
Trouble gaining weight.
Getting tired easily during play or exercise.
Irritability.
Crying for long periods of time.
Fainting.

Tet spellsSome babies with tetralogy of Fallot suddenly develop deep blue or gray skin, nails, and lips. This usually happens when the baby cries, eats or is upset. These episodes are called tet spells.
Tet spells are caused by a rapid drop in the amount of oxygen in the blood. They are most common in young infants, around 2 to 4 months old. Tet spells may be less noticeable in toddlers and older children. That's because they typically squat when they're short of breath. Squatting sends more blood to the lungs.
