HivesThe welts associated with hives can be:

Skin-colored, reddish on white skin, or purplish on black and brown skin
Itchy, ranging from mild to intense
Round, oval or worm-shaped
As small as a pea or as large as a dinner plate

Most hives appear quickly and go away within 24 hours. This is known as acute hives. Chronic hives can last for months or years.
