There are three types of plague. The symptoms vary for each type.
Bubonic plagueBubonic plague causes swelling of lymph nodes. These are small, bean-shaped filters in the body's immune system. A swollen lymph node is called a bubo. The word "bubonic" is describing this feature of the disease.
If a person has bubonic plague, buboes appear in the armpits, groin or neck. Buboes are tender or painful. They vary in size from about less than half an inch (1 centimeter) to about 4 inches (10 centimeters).
Other symptoms of bubonic plague may include:

Sudden high fever and chills.
Headache.
Tiredness.
Not feeling well in general.
Weakness.
Muscle aches.
Rarely, skin sores.

Septicemic plagueSepticemic plague occurs when plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream. Buboes may not be present.
Early symptoms are very general and include:

Sudden high fever and chills.
Extreme weakness.
Stomach pain, diarrhea and vomiting.

More-serious symptoms may develop with advanced disease and organ failure. These include:

Bleeding from the mouth, nose or rectum, or under the skin.
Signs of shock, such as seizure, rash and low blood pressure.
Blackening and death of tissue, called gangrene, most commonly on the fingers, toes, ears and nose.

Pneumonic plaguePneumonic plague affects the lungs. The disease may begin in the lungs, or it may spread from infected lymph nodes to the lungs. Symptoms can begin within a few hours after exposure and worsen rapidly.
Symptoms may include:

Sudden high fever and chills.
Cough, with bloody mucus.
Difficulty or irregular breathing.
Chest pain.
Upset stomach and vomiting.
Headache.
Weakness.

If treatment is not begun the first day, the disease progresses rapidly to failure of the lungs, shock and death.
