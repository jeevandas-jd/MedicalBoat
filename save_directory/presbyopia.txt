Presbyopia develops gradually. You may first notice these signs and symptoms after age 40:

A tendency to hold reading material farther away to make the letters clearer
Blurred vision at normal reading distance
Eyestrain or headaches after reading or doing close-up work

You may notice these symptoms are worse if you are tired or are in an area with dim lighting.
