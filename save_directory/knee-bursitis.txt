Knee bursitis symptoms vary. They depend on which bursa is affected and what's causing the inflammation.
The affected portion of your knee might feel warm, tender and swollen. You also might feel pain when you move or when you're at rest.
A direct blow to the knee can cause symptoms to come on fast. But knee bursitis often stems from friction and irritation of the bursae. This can occur with jobs that require a lot of kneeling on hard surfaces. So, the symptoms can start slowly and become worse over time.
