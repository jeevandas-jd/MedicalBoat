are usually noticed during pregnancy, immediately after birth or within a few weeks of birth. Without treatment, serious complications or death can occur.
Congenitally corrected transposition, also called levo-transposition of the great arteries (L-TGA). This is a less common type. Symptoms may not be noticed right away. Treatment depends on the specific heart problems.

Surgery to correct the positions of the arteries is the usual treatment. The surgery is usually done soon after birth.Products & ServicesA Book: Mayo Clinic Family Health BookNewsletter: Mayo Clinic Health Letter â€” Digital EditionShow more products from Mayo Clinic





SymptomsTransposition of the great arteries (TGA) may be seen in a baby before birth during a routine pregnancy ultrasound.
But some people with the congenitally corrected type of TGA may not have symptoms for many years.
Symptoms of transposition of the great arteries after birth include:

Blue or gray skin. Depending on the baby's skin color, these color changes may be harder or easier to see.
Weak pulse.
Lack of appetite.
Poor weight gain.

Skin color changes may not be noticed right away if a baby with TGA also has other heart problems. This is because the other heart problems may let some oxygen-rich blood move through the body. But as the baby becomes more active, less blood flows through the body. The blue or gray skin color then becomes more noticeable.
