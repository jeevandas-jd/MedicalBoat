Typical agoraphobia symptoms include fear of:

Leaving home alone.
Crowds or waiting in line.
Enclosed spaces, such as movie theaters, elevators or small stores.
Open spaces, such as parking lots, bridges or malls.
Using public transportation, such as a bus, plane or train.

These situations cause anxiety because you fear you won't be able to escape or find help if you start to feel panicked. Or you may fear having other disabling or embarrassing symptoms, such as dizziness, fainting, falling or diarrhea.
In addition:

Your fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger of the situation.
You avoid the situation, you need a companion to go with you, or you endure the situation but are extremely upset.
You have major distress or problems with social situations, work or other areas in your life because of the fear, anxiety or avoidance.
Your fear and avoidance usually lasts six months or longer.
