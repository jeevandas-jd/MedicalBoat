Symptoms of somatic symptom disorder may be:

Specific sensations, such as pain or shortness of breath, or more general symptoms, such as fatigue or weakness
Unrelated to any medical cause that can be identified, or related to a medical condition such as cancer or heart disease, but more significant than what's usually expected
A single symptom, multiple symptoms or varying symptoms
Mild, moderate or severe

Pain is the most common symptom, but whatever your symptoms, you have excessive thoughts, feelings or behaviors related to those symptoms, which cause significant problems, make it difficult to function and sometimes can be disabling.
These thoughts, feelings and behaviors can include:

Constant worry about potential illness
Viewing normal physical sensations as a sign of severe physical illness
Fearing that symptoms are serious, even when there is no evidence
Thinking that physical sensations are threatening or harmful
Feeling that medical evaluation and treatment have not been adequate
Fearing that physical activity may cause damage to your body
Repeatedly checking your body for abnormalities
Frequent health care visits that don't relieve your concerns or that make them worse
Being unresponsive to medical treatment or unusually sensitive to medication side effects
Having a more severe impairment than is usually expected from a medical condition

For somatic symptom disorder, more important than the specific physical symptoms you experience is the way you interpret and react to the symptoms and how they impact your daily life.
