Types of nerve damage


Types of nerve damage
Part of the spine (on left) shows how nerve roots connect to the spinal cord. The most serious types of nerve injuries are an avulsion (A), where the nerve roots are torn away from the spinal cord, and rupture (C), where the nerve is torn into two pieces. A less serious injury is stretching (B) of the nerve fibers.





Symptoms of a brachial plexus injury can differ depending on how serious the injury is and where it's located. Usually only one arm is affected.
Less severe injuriesMinor damage often happens during contact sports, such as football or wrestling, when the brachial plexus nerves get stretched or squeezed together. These are called stingers or burners. Some of the symptoms are:

A feeling like an electric shock or a burning sensation shooting down the arm.
Numbness and weakness in the arm.

These symptoms usually last only a few seconds or minutes, but in some people the symptoms may last for days or longer.
More-serious injuriesMore-serious symptoms happen when an injury seriously damages or even tears or ruptures the nerves. The most serious brachial plexus injury is when the nerve root is cut or torn from the spinal cord.
Symptoms of serious injuries can include:

Weakness or not being able to use certain muscles in the hand, arm or shoulder.
Loss of feeling in the arm, including the shoulder and hand.
Intense pain.
