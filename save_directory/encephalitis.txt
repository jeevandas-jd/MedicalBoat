Encephalitis may cause many different symptoms including confusion, personality changes, seizures or trouble with movement. Encephalitis also may cause changes in sight or hearing.
Most people with infectious encephalitis have flu-like symptoms, such as:

Headache.
Fever.
Aches in muscles or joints.
Fatigue or weakness.

Typically, these are followed by more-serious symptoms over a period of hours to days, such as:

Stiff neck.
Confusion, agitation or hallucinations.
Seizures.
Loss of feeling or being unable to move certain areas of the face or body.
Irregular movements.
Muscle weakness.
Trouble with speech or hearing.
Loss of consciousness, including coma.

In infants and young children, symptoms also might include:

Bulging of the soft spots of an infant's skull.
Nausea and vomiting.
Stiffness affecting the whole body.
Poor feeding or not waking for a feeding.
Irritability.

Bulging fontanel


Bulging fontanel
One of the major signs of encephalitis in infants is a bulging of the soft spot, also known as the fontanel, of the baby's skull. Pictured here is the anterior fontanel. Other fontanels are found on the sides and back of an infant's head.





In autoimmune encephalitis, symptoms may develop more slowly over several weeks. Flu-like symptoms are less common but can sometimes happen weeks before more-serious symptoms start. Symptoms are different for everyone, but it's common for people to have a combination of symptoms, including:

Changes in personality.
Memory loss.
Trouble understanding what is real and what is not, known as psychosis.
Seeing or hearing things that aren't there, known as hallucinations.
Seizures.
Changes in vision.
Sleep problems.
Muscle weakness.
Loss of sensation.
Trouble walking.
Irregular movements.
Bladder and bowel symptoms.
