Thoracic aortic aneurysms often grow slowly. There are usually no symptoms, making them difficult to detect. Many start small and stay small. Others grow bigger over time. How quickly a thoracic aortic aneurysm may grow is difficult to predict.
As a thoracic aortic aneurysm grows, symptoms may include:

Back pain.
Cough.
Weak, scratchy voice.
Shortness of breath.
Tenderness or pain in the chest.

Symptoms that a thoracic aortic aneurysm has ruptured or dissected include:

Sharp, sudden pain in the upper back that spreads downward.
Pain in the chest, jaw, neck or arms.
Difficulty breathing.
Low blood pressure.
Loss of consciousness.
Shortness of breath.
Trouble swallowing.

Some aneurysms may never rupture or lead to dissection.
