Infantile eczema
Atopic dermatitis in infants (infantile eczema) appears here as red, itchy patches on very dry skin.





Atopic dermatitis (eczema) symptoms can appear anywhere on the body and vary widely from person to person. They may include:

Dry, cracked skin
Itchiness (pruritus)
Rash on swollen skin that varies in color depending on your skin color
Small, raised bumps, on brown or Black skin
Oozing and crusting
Thickened skin
Darkening of the skin around the eyes
Raw, sensitive skin from scratching

Atopic dermatitis often begins before age 5 and may continue into the teen and adult years. For some people, it flares and then clears up for a time, even for several years.
