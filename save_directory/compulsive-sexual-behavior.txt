Some signs that you may have compulsive sexual behavior include:

You have repeated and intense sexual fantasies, urges, and behaviors that take up a lot of your time and feel as if they're beyond your control.
You feel driven or have frequent urges to do certain sexual behaviors, feel a release of the tension afterward, but also feel guilt or deep regret.
You've tried without success to reduce or control your sexual fantasies, urges or behavior.
You use compulsive sexual behavior as an escape from other problems, such as loneliness, depression, anxiety or stress.
You continue to engage in sexual behaviors in spite of them causing serious problems. These could include the possibility of getting or giving someone else a sexually transmitted infection, the loss of important relationships, trouble at work, financial issues, or legal problems.
