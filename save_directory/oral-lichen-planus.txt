Other types of lichen planusIf you have oral lichen planus, you may have lichen planus lesions affecting other parts of your body.

Skin. Lesions usually appear as purplish, flat-topped bumps that are often itchy.
Genitals. Lesions on the female genitalia often cause pain or burning and discomfort with intercourse. The lesions are usually red and eroded and occasionally appear as white areas. Lesions can also occur on male genitalia.
Ears. Lichen planus of the ears can lead to hearing loss.
Scalp. When skin lesions appear on the scalp, they may cause temporary or permanent hair loss.
Nails. Though rare, lichen planus of the toenails or fingernails may result in ridges on the nails, thinning or splitting of nails, and temporary or permanent nail loss.
Eyes. Rarely, lichen planus may involve the mucous membrane surfaces of the eyes, and can cause scarring and blindness.
Esophagus. Lichen planus of the esophagus is rare, but when it occurs, it may result in a narrowing of the esophagus or the formation of tightened, ringlike bands in the esophagus that can make swallowing difficult.
