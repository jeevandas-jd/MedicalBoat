Raynaud's disease


Raynaud's disease
Raynaud's disease causes smaller arteries that supply blood flow to the skin to narrow in response to cold or stress. The affected body parts, usually fingers and toes, might turn white then blue. Depending on your skin color, these color changes may be harder or easier to see. The affected areas may feel cold and numb until blood flow improves, usually after warming up.





Symptoms of Raynaud's disease include:

Cold fingers or toes.
Areas of skin that turn white then blue. Depending on your skin color, these color changes may be harder or easier to see.
Numb, prickly feeling or stinging pain upon warming or stress relief.

During an attack of Raynaud's, affected areas of the skin usually first turn pale. Next, they often change color and feel cold and numb. When the skin warms and blood flow improves, the affected areas may change color again, throb, tingle or swell.
Raynaud's most commonly affects fingers and toes. But it also can affect other areas of the body, such as nose, lips, ears and even nipples. After warming up, the return of blood flow to the area can take 15 minutes.
