Left ventricular hypertrophy usually develops gradually. Some people do not have symptoms, especially during the early stages of the condition.
Left ventricular hypertrophy itself doesn't cause symptoms. But symptoms may occur as the strain on the heart worsens. They may include:

Shortness of breath, especially while lying down.
Swelling of the legs.
Chest pain, often when exercising.
Sensation of rapid, fluttering or pounding heartbeats, called palpitations.
Fainting or a feeling of lightheadedness.
