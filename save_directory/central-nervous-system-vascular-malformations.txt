Symptoms depend on the type of central nervous system vascular malformation and where it's found. Some vascular malformations have no symptoms. They're found on imaging for something else.
Symptoms for some central nervous system vascular malformations can include:

Bleeding.
Seizures.
Headache.
Brain and nervous system problems, called neurological deficits, that get worse over time. Neurological deficits can affect speech, vision, balance, memory and other abilities.
