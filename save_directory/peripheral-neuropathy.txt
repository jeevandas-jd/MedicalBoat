Every nerve in the peripheral system has a specific job. Symptoms depend on the type of nerves affected. Nerves are divided into:

Sensory nerves that receive sensation, such as temperature, pain, vibration or touch, from the skin.
Motor nerves that control muscle movement.
Autonomic nerves that control functions such as blood pressure, sweating, heart rate, digestion and bladder function.

Symptoms of peripheral neuropathy might include:

Gradual onset of numbness, prickling, or tingling in your feet or hands. These sensations can spread upward into your legs and arms.
Sharp, jabbing, throbbing or burning pain.
Extreme sensitivity to touch.
Pain during activities that shouldn't cause pain, such as pain in your feet when putting weight on them or when they're under a blanket.
Lack of coordination and falling.
Muscle weakness.
Feeling as if you're wearing gloves or socks when you're not.
Inability to move if motor nerves are affected.

If autonomic nerves are affected, symptoms might include:

Heat intolerance.
Excessive sweating or not being able to sweat.
Bowel, bladder or digestive problems.
Drops in blood pressure, causing dizziness or lightheadedness.

Peripheral neuropathy can affect one nerve, called mononeuropathy. If it affects two or more nerves in different areas, it's called multiple mononeuropathy, and if it affects many nerves, it's called polyneuropathy. Carpal tunnel syndrome is an example of mononeuropathy. Most people with peripheral neuropathy have polyneuropathy.
