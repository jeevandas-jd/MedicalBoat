Petechiae


Petechiae
Bleeding into the skin looks like tiny reddish-purple spots, also known as petechiae. Petechiae might look like a rash. Here they appear on a leg (A) and on the stomach area (B).





People with myelodysplastic syndromes might not experience signs and symptoms at first.
In time, myelodysplastic syndromes might cause:

Fatigue
Shortness of breath
Unusual paleness (pallor), which occurs due to a low red blood cell count (anemia)
Easy or unusual bruising or bleeding, which occurs due to a low blood platelet count (thrombocytopenia)
Pinpoint-sized red spots just beneath the skin that are caused by bleeding (petechiae)
Frequent infections, which occur due to a low white blood cell count (leukopenia)
