Thyroid gland


Thyroid gland
The thyroid gland sits at the base of the neck.





The symptoms of hypothyroidism depend on the severity of the condition. Problems tend to develop slowly, often over several years.
At first, you may barely notice the symptoms of hypothyroidism, such as fatigue and weight gain. Or you may think they are just part of getting older. But as your metabolism continues to slow, you may develop more-obvious problems.
Hypothyroidism symptoms may include:

Tiredness.
More sensitivity to cold.
Constipation.
Dry skin.
Weight gain.
Puffy face.
Hoarse voice.
Coarse hair and skin.
Muscle weakness.
Muscle aches, tenderness and stiffness.
Menstrual cycles that are heavier than usual or irregular.
Thinning hair.
Slowed heart rate, also called bradycardia.
Depression.
Memory problems.

Hypothyroidism in infantsAnyone can get hypothyroidism, including infants. Most babies born without a thyroid gland or with a gland that doesn't work correctly don't have symptoms right away. But if hypothyroidism isn't diagnosed and treated, symptoms start to appear. They may include:

Feeding problems.
Poor growth.
Poor weight gain.
Yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes, a condition called jaundice.
Constipation.
Poor muscle tone.
Dry skin.
Hoarse crying.
Enlarged tongue.
A soft swelling or bulge near the belly button, a condition called umbilical hernia.

When hypothyroidism in infants isn't treated, even mild cases can lead to severe physical and mental development problems.
Hypothyroidism in children and teensIn general, children and teens with hypothyroidism have symptoms similar to those in adults. But they also may have:

Poor growth that leads to short stature.
Delayed development of permanent teeth.
Delayed puberty.
Poor mental development.
