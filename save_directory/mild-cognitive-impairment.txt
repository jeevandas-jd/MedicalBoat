The brain, like the rest of the body, changes with age. Many people notice they become more forgetful as they age. It may take longer to think of a word or to recall a person's name.
If concerns with mental function go beyond what's expected, the symptoms may be due to mild cognitive impairment (MCI). MCI may be the cause of changes in thinking if:

You forget things more often.
You miss appointments or social events.
You lose your train of thought. Or you can't follow the plot of a book or movie.
You have trouble following a conversation.
You find it hard to make decisions, finish a task or follow instructions.
You start to have trouble finding your way around places you know well.
You begin to have poor judgment.
Your family and friends notice any of these changes.

If you have MCI, you also may experience:

Depression.
Anxiety.
A short temper and aggression.
A lack of interest.
