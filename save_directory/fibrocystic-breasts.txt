Signs and symptoms of fibrocystic breasts may include:

Breast lumps or areas of thickening that tend to blend into the surrounding breast tissue
Generalized breast pain or tenderness or discomfort that involves the upper outer part of the breast
Breast nodules or lumpy tissue change in size with the menstrual cycle
Green or dark brown nonbloody nipple discharge that tends to leak without pressure or squeezing
Breast changes that are similar in both breasts
Monthly increase in breast pain or lumpiness from midcycle (ovulation) to just before your period and then gets better once your period starts

Fibrocystic breast changes occur most often between 30 and 50 years of age. These changes happen rarely after menopause unless you're taking hormone replacement medicine such as estrogen or progesterone.
