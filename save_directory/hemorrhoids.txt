Symptoms of hemorrhoids usually depend on the type of hemorrhoid.
Internal hemorrhoidsInternal hemorrhoids lie inside the rectum. You usually can't see or feel them, and they rarely cause discomfort. But straining or irritation when passing stool can cause:

Painless bleeding during bowel movements. You might notice small amounts of bright red blood on your toilet tissue or in the toilet.
A hemorrhoid to push through the anal opening, called a prolapsed or protruding hemorrhoid. This may result in pain and irritation.

External hemorrhoidsThese are under the skin around the anus. Symptoms might include:

Itching or irritation in the anal region.
Pain or discomfort.
Swelling around the anus.
Bleeding.

Thrombosed hemorrhoidsBlood can pool in an external hemorrhoid and form a clot, called a thrombus. A thrombosed hemorrhoid can result in:

Severe pain.
Swelling.
Inflammation.
A hard, discolored lump near the anus.
