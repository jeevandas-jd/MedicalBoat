A pheochromocytoma often causes the following symptoms:

High blood pressure.
Headache.
Heavy sweating.
Rapid heartbeat.

Some people with pheochromocytomas also have symptoms such as:

Nervous shaking.
Skin that turns a lighter color, also called pallor.
Shortness of breath.
Panic attack-type symptoms, which can include sudden intense fear.
Anxiety or a sense of doom.
Vision problems.
Constipation.
Weight loss.

Some people with pheochromocytomas have no symptoms. They don't realize they have the tumor until an imaging test happens to find it.
Symptom spellsMost often, the symptoms of pheochromocytoma come and go. When they start suddenly and keep coming back, they're known as spells or attacks. These spells may or may not have a trigger that can be found.
Certain activities or conditions can lead to a spell, such as:

Physical hard work.
Anxiety or stress.
Changes in body position, such as bending over, or going from sitting or lying down to standing.
Labor and delivery.
Surgery and a medicine that causes you to be in a sleep-like state during surgery, called an anesthetic.

Foods high in tyramine, a substance that affects blood pressure, also can trigger spells. Tyramine is common in foods that are fermented, aged, pickled, cured, overripe or spoiled. These foods include:

Some cheeses.
Some beers and wines.
Soybeans or products made with soy.
Chocolate.
Dried or smoked meats.

Certain medicines and drugs that can trigger spells include:

Depression medicines called tricyclic antidepressants. Some examples of tricyclic antidepressants are amitriptyline and desipramine (Norpramin).
Depression medicines called monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), such as phenelzine (Nardil), tranylcypromine (Parnate) and isocarboxazid (Marplan). The risk of spells is even higher if these medicines are taken with foods or drinks high in tyramine.
Stimulants such as caffeine, amphetamines or cocaine.
