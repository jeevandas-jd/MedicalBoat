Fecal incontinence may occur during an occasional bout of diarrhea. But for some people, fecal incontinence happens a lot. People with this condition may not be able to stop the urge to defecate. It may come on so suddenly that you can't make it to the toilet in time. This is called urge incontinence.
Another type of fecal incontinence occurs in people who are not aware of the need to pass stool. This is called passive incontinence.
Fecal incontinence may happen with other bowel problems, such as:

Diarrhea.
Constipation.
Gas and bloating.
