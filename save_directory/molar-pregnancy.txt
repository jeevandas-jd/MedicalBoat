Molar pregnancy


Molar pregnancy
During a molar pregnancy, the placenta doesn't form typically. It can look like a mass of cysts. The fetus either doesn't form or doesn't form regularly and can't survive.





A molar pregnancy may seem like a regular pregnancy at first. But most molar pregnancies cause symptoms that can include:

Dark brown to bright red bleeding from the vagina during the first three months
Severe nausea and vomiting
Sometimes grapelike cysts that pass from the vagina
Pelvic pressure or pain

Because of improved ways of detecting a molar pregnancy, most are found in the first trimester. If it is not found in the first three months, symptoms of a molar pregnancy might include:

A uterus growing quickly and being too large early in the pregnancy
Preeclampsia — a condition that causes high blood pressure and protein in the urine — before 20 weeks of pregnancy
Ovarian cysts
Overactive thyroid, also known as hyperthyroidism
