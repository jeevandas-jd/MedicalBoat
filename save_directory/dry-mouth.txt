If you're not producing enough saliva, you may notice these symptoms all or most of the time:

Dryness or a feeling of stickiness in your mouth.
Saliva that seems thick and stringy.
Bad breath.
Having a hard time chewing, speaking and swallowing.
Dry or sore throat and hoarseness.
Dry or grooved tongue.
A changed sense of taste.
Problems wearing dentures.
Lipstick stuck to teeth.

Saliva helps prevent tooth decay by washing away sugar and food particles and making bacteria neutral and less harmful. When you don't have enough saliva, you may find it harder to taste, chew and swallow. You also may have a hard time digesting food.
