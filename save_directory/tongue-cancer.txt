Tongue cancer might not cause symptoms at first. Sometimes it's found by a doctor or dentist who examines the mouth for signs of cancer as part of a checkup.
When tongue cancer happens in the mouth, the first sign is often a sore on the tongue that doesn't heal. Other symptoms may include pain or bleeding in the mouth and a lump or thickening on the tongue.
When tongue cancer happens in the throat, the first sign can be swollen lymph nodes in the neck. Other symptoms may include coughing up blood, weight loss and ear pain. There also may be a lump in the back of the mouth, throat or neck.
Other tongue cancer symptoms may include:

A red or white patch on the tongue or lining of the mouth.
A sore throat that doesn't go away.
A feeling that something is caught in the throat.
    
Numbness of the mouth or tongue.
Difficulty or pain with chewing, swallowing, or moving the jaws or tongue.
Swelling of the jaw.
A change in voice.
