Nearsightedness symptoms may include:

Blurry vision when looking at distant objects.
The need to squint or partially close the eyelids to see clearly.
Headaches.
Eyestrain.

School-age children may have difficulty seeing things on whiteboards or screen projections in the classroom. Younger children might not express difficulty seeing, but they may have the following behaviors that suggest difficulty seeing:

Constant squinting.
Seeming to not be aware of distant objects.
Blinking often.
Rubbing the eyes often.
Sitting close to the television or moving screens closer to the face.

Adults with nearsightedness may notice difficulty reading street signs or signs in stores. Some people may experience blurry vision in dim light, as with nighttime driving, even if they see clearly in daylight. This condition is called night myopia.
