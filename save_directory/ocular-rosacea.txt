Signs and symptoms of ocular rosacea can precede the skin symptoms of rosacea, develop at the same time, develop later or occur on their own. Signs and symptoms of ocular rosacea may include:

Red, burning, itchy or watering eyes
Dry eyes
Grittiness or the feeling of having a foreign body in the eye or eyes
Blurred vision
Sensitivity to light (photophobia)
Dilated small blood vessels on the white part of the eye that are visible when you look in a mirror
Red, swollen eyelids
Recurrent eye or eyelid infections, such as pink eye (conjunctivitis), blepharitis, sties or chalazia

The severity of ocular rosacea symptoms doesn't always match the severity of skin symptoms.
