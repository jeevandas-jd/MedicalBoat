Symptoms of auditory processing disorder (APD) can be subtle. Symptoms can include having trouble with:

Telling where sound is coming from.
Understanding words that are spoken quickly or in a noisy room.
Paying attention.
Reading and spelling.
Following directions unless they are short and simple.
Learning a new language.
Singing or enjoying music.
Understanding and remembering spoken information.

If you have APD, you also might:

Take longer to reply to someone who is talking to you.
Often need others to repeat themselves.
Not understand sarcasm or jokes.

APD is often seen with attention, language and learning issues like those seen in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD.
