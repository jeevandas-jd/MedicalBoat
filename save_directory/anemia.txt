Anemia symptoms depend on the cause and how bad the anemia is. Anemia can be so mild that it causes no symptoms at first. But symptoms usually then occur and get worse as the anemia gets worse.
If another disease causes the anemia, the disease can mask the anemia symptoms. Then a test for another condition might find the anemia. Certain types of anemia have symptoms that point to the cause.
Possible symptoms of anemia include:

Tiredness.
Weakness.
Shortness of breath.
Pale or yellowish skin, which might be more obvious on white skin than on Black or brown skin.
Irregular heartbeat.
Dizziness or lightheadedness.
Chest pain.
Cold hands and feet.
Headaches.
