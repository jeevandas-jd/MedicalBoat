The liver
The liver is the largest internal organ in the body. It's about the size of a football. It sits mainly in the upper right portion of the stomach area, above the stomach.





Cirrhosis often has no symptoms until liver damage is severe. When symptoms do occur, they may include:

Fatigue.
Easily bleeding or bruising.
Loss of appetite.
Nausea.
Swelling in the legs, feet or ankles, called edema.
Weight loss.
Itchy skin.
Yellow discoloration in the skin and eyes, called jaundice.
Fluid accumulation in the abdomen, called ascites (uh-SAHY-teez).
Spiderlike blood vessels on the skin.
Redness in the palms of the hands.
Pale fingernails, especially the thumb and index finger.
Clubbing of the fingers, in which the fingertips spread out and become rounder than usual.
For women, absence of or loss of periods not related to menopause.
For men, loss of sex drive, testicular shrinkage or breast enlargement, known as gynecomastia.
Confusion, drowsiness or slurred speech.
