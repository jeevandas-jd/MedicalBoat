Your medical team will likely be the first to notice atypical genitalia soon after your baby is born. Sometimes, atypical genitalia may be suspected before birth. Atypical genitalia can vary in appearance. Differences may depend on when during genital development the hormone changes that affected development occurred and the cause.
Babies who are genetically female, which means they have two X chromosomes, may have:

An enlarged clitoris, which may look like a penis.
Closed labia, or labia that include folds and look like a scrotum.
Lumps that feel like testicles in the fused labia.

Babies who are genetically male, which means they have one X and one Y chromosome, may have:

A condition in which the narrow tube that carries urine and semen, called the urethra, doesn't fully extend to the tip of the penis. If the tube opening is on the underside of the penis, the condition is called hypospadias.
A very small penis with the urethral opening closer to the scrotum.
One or both testicles missing in what appears to be the scrotum.
Testicles that remain in the body, also called undescended testicles, and an empty scrotum that has the appearance of labia with or without a micropenis.
