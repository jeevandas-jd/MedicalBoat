Schizoaffective disorder symptoms may vary from person to person. People with the condition have psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions. They also can have symptoms of a mood disorder. This type of schizophrenia could be the bipolar type, which features bouts of mania and sometimes depression. Or it could be the depressive type, which features bouts of depression.
How schizoaffective disorder starts and how it affects people may vary. But defining features include a major bout of depressed or manic mood and at least a two-week period of psychotic symptoms when mood symptoms are not present.
Symptoms of schizoaffective disorder depend on the type — bipolar or depressive. Symptoms may include:

Delusions — having false, fixed beliefs, despite facts showing that they're not true.
Hallucinations, such as hearing voices or seeing things that others don't observe.
Disorganized thinking and speech.
Bizarre or unusual behavior.
Symptoms of depression, such as feeling empty, sad or worthless.
Periods of manic mood, with more energy and less need for sleep over several days, and behaviors that are out of character.
Having a hard time functioning at work or school or in social situations.
Problems managing personal care, such as not looking clean and not taking care in how one looks.
