Symptoms of Kawasaki disease include a fever greater than 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit (39 degrees Celsius) for five or more days. And the child  has at least four of the following symptoms.

A rash on the main part of the body or in the genital area.
An enlarged lymph node in the neck.
Very red eyes without a thick discharge.
Red, dry, cracked lips and a red, swollen tongue.
Swollen, red skin on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. Later the skin on fingers and toes peels.

The symptoms might not happen at the same time. Let your child's healthcare professional know about a symptom that has gone away.
Other symptoms might include:

Belly pain.
Diarrhea.
Fussiness.
Joint pain.
Vomiting.

Some children get a high fever for five or more days but have fewer than four of the symptoms needed for a diagnosis of Kawasaki disease. They might have what's called incomplete Kawasaki disease. Children with incomplete Kawasaki disease are still at risk of damage to the heart arteries. They still need treatment within 10 days of when symptoms appear.
Kawasaki disease can have symptoms like those of a condition called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. The syndrome happens in children with COVID-19.
