Calciphylaxis symptoms include:

Large netlike patterns on the skin that may look purple-pink in color.
Deep, painful lumps in the skin that can become ulcers. The ulcers often have a black-brown crust that doesn't heal on its own. Ulcers tend to appear in areas with high fat content, such as the stomach, thighs, buttocks and breasts. But they can form anywhere.
Infections from ulcers that don't heal.
