Rheumatic fever symptoms usually start about 2 to 4 weeks after a strep throat infection. Symptoms are due to swelling, called inflammation, in the heart, joints, skin or central nervous system. There may be few symptoms or several. Symptoms can come and go or change while a person is sick with rheumatic fever.
Rheumatic fever symptoms can include:

Fever.
Joint pain or swelling â€” most often the knees, ankles, elbows and wrists. Joints may feel hot or tender.
Pain in one joint that travels to another joint.
Chest pain.
Fatigue.
Small, painless bumps beneath the skin.
Flat or slightly raised, painless rash with a ragged edge.

Some people with rheumatic fever develop a condition called Sydenham chorea. Symptoms of this condition include:

Jerky, uncontrollable body movements, most often in the hands, feet and face.
Outbursts of crying or inappropriate laughing.
