Shoulder dislocation


Shoulder dislocation
The shoulder joint is the most frequently dislocated joint of the body. Because it moves in several directions, your shoulder can dislocate forward, backward or downward. The most common variety is a forward (anterior) dislocation.





Dislocated shoulder symptoms can include:

A visibly deformed or out-of-place shoulder
Swelling or bruising
Intense pain
Inability to move the joint

Shoulder dislocation can also cause numbness, weakness or tingling near the injury, such as in the neck or down the arm. The muscles in the shoulder might spasm, which can increase the pain.
