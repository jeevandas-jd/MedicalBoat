Depending on the joint that's affected, signs and symptoms of osteochondritis dissecans might include:

Pain. This most common symptom of osteochondritis dissecans might be triggered by physical activity â€” walking up stairs, climbing a hill or playing sports.
Swelling and tenderness. The skin around your joint might be swollen and tender.
Joint popping or locking. Your joint might pop or stick in one position if a loose fragment gets caught between bones during movement.
Joint weakness. You might feel as though your joint is "giving way" or weakening.
Decreased range of motion. You might be unable to straighten the affected limb completely.
