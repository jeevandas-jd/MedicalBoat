typically begin with balance trouble. People with PLS may move slowly and are clumsy. Over time, symptoms evolve to include having trouble with their hands and arms, followed by problems with chewing, swallowing and speaking. Less commonly, the condition may begin with problems with speaking and swallowing.
This rare condition can develop at any age, but it usually occurs between ages 40 and 60. PLS is more common in men than in women. Rarely, PLS can begin in early childhood. This subtype is known as juvenile primary lateral sclerosis. Juvenile PLS is caused by a change in a gene that's passed from both parents to a child.
PLS is often mistaken for another, more common motor neuron disease called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). While likely related to ALS, PLS gets worse more slowly than ALS. In most people, PLS isn't fatal.Products & ServicesA Book: Mayo Clinic Family Health BookNewsletter: Mayo Clinic Health Letter â€” Digital EditionShow more products from Mayo Clinic





SymptomsSymptoms of primary lateral sclerosis usually take years to develop and get worse. Symptoms generally begin in the legs. Rarely, PLS begins with weakness in the tongue or hands. Then weakness gradually moves down the spinal cord to the legs. However, symptoms vary from person to person. Symptoms may include:

Stiffness, weakness and muscle spasms in the legs. This is known as spasticity. Rarely, spasticity starts in only one leg and moves to the arms, hands, tongue and jaw.
Slowed movement.
Tripping, being clumsy and having trouble with balance.
Hand clumsiness.
A hoarse voice, as well as slowed, slurred speech and drooling.
Trouble chewing and swallowing.
Sometimes, frequent, rapid and intense shifts in emotions.
Rarely, breathing problems and bladder problems late in the disease.
