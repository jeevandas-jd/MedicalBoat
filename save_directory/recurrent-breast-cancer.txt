Signs and symptoms of recurrent breast cancer vary depending on where the cancer comes back.
Local recurrenceIn a local recurrence, cancer reappears in the same area as your original cancer.
If you've undergone a lumpectomy, the cancer could recur in the remaining breast tissue. If you've undergone a mastectomy, the cancer could recur in the tissue that lines the chest wall or in the skin.
Signs and symptoms of local recurrence within the same breast may include:

A new lump in your breast or irregular area of firmness.
Changes to the skin of your breast.
Skin inflammation or area of redness.
Nipple discharge.

Signs and symptoms of local recurrence on the chest wall after a mastectomy may include:

One or more painless nodules on or under the skin of your chest wall.
A new area of thickening along or near the mastectomy scar.

Regional recurrenceA regional breast cancer recurrence means the cancer has come back in the nearby lymph nodes.
Signs and symptoms of regional recurrence may include a lump or swelling in the lymph nodes located:

Under your arm.
Near your collarbone.
In the groove above your collarbone.
In your neck.

Distant recurrenceA distant (metastatic) recurrence means the cancer has traveled to distant parts of the body, most commonly the bones, liver and lungs.
Signs and symptoms include:

Persistent and worsening pain, such as chest, back or hip pain.
Persistent cough.
Difficulty breathing.
Loss of appetite.
Weight loss without trying.
Severe headaches.
Seizures.
