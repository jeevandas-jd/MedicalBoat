The symptoms of an alpha-gal allergic reaction usually take longer to start compared with those of other food allergies. Most reactions to common food allergens — peanuts or shellfish, for example — happen within minutes after you are exposed to them. In alpha-gal syndrome, reactions usually appear about 3 to 6 hours after you are exposed. Foods that can cause a reaction include:

Red meat, such as beef, pork or lamb.
Organ meats.
Products made from mammals, such as gelatins or dairy products.

Symptoms of alpha-gal syndrome may include:

Hives, itching, or itchy, scaly skin.
Swelling of the lips, face, tongue and throat, or other body parts.
Wheezing or shortness of breath.
Stomach pain, diarrhea, upset stomach or vomiting.

The time delay between eating meat products and getting an allergic reaction may be one reason alpha-gal syndrome was not understood at first. For example, a possible connection between a T-bone steak with dinner and hives at midnight is far from clear.
Researchers think they know the reason for the delayed reaction. They say it's due to the alpha-gal molecules taking longer than other allergens to be digested and enter the system that moves blood through the body.
