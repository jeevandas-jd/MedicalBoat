The average time from infection to appearance of signs and symptoms (incubation period) is 10 days. The incubation period can range from 3 to 21 days.
The most common type of tetanus is called generalized tetanus. Signs and symptoms begin gradually and then progressively worsen over two weeks. They usually start at the jaw and progress downward on the body.
Signs and symptoms of generalized tetanus include:

Painful muscle spasms and stiff, immovable muscles (muscle rigidity) in your jaw
Tension of muscles around your lips, sometimes producing a persistent grin
Painful spasms and rigidity in your neck muscles
Difficulty swallowing
Rigid abdominal muscles

Progression of tetanus results in repeated painful, seizure-like spasms that last for several minutes (generalized spasms). Usually, the neck and back arch, the legs become rigid, the arms are drawn up to the body, and the fists are clenched. Muscle rigidity in the neck and abdomen may cause breathing difficulties.
These severe spasms may be triggered by minor events that stimulate the senses â€” a loud sound, a physical touch, a draft or light.
As the disease progresses, other signs and symptoms may include:

High blood pressure
Low blood pressure
Rapid heart rate
Fever
Extreme sweating

Localized tetanusThis uncommon form of tetanus results in muscles spasms near the site of a wound. While it's usually a less severe form of disease, it can progress to generalized tetanus.
Cephalic tetanusThis rare form of tetanus results from a head wound. It results in weakened muscles in the face and spasms of the jaw muscles. It also can progress to generalized tetanus.
