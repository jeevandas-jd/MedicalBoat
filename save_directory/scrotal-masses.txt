Male reproductive system


Male reproductive system
The male reproductive system makes, stores and moves sperm. The testicles produce sperm. Fluid from the seminal vesicles and prostate gland combines with sperm to make semen. The penis ejaculates semen during sexual intercourse.





Symptoms of scrotal masses vary. Some cause pain and others don't. It depends on the cause. Symptoms of a scrotal mass might include:

An unusual lump.
Sudden pain.
Dull aching or a feeling of heaviness in the scrotum.
Pain that spreads all over the groin, stomach area or lower back.
A tender, swollen or hardened testicle or epididymis (ep-ih-DID-uh-miss). The epididymis is the soft, comma-shaped tube above and behind the testicle that stores and transports sperm.
Swelling in the scrotum.
A change in color of the skin of the scrotum.
Upset stomach or vomiting.

If an infection causes a scrotal mass, symptoms also might include:

Fever.
Needing to pee often.
Pus or blood in the urine.
