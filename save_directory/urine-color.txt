The regular color of urine varies. It depends on how much water you drink. Fluids dilute the yellow pigments in urine. So the more you drink, the clearer your urine looks. When you drink less, the yellow color becomes stronger.
But urine can turn colors far beyond what's typical, including:

Red.
Blue.
Green.
Orange.
Dark brown.
Cloudy white.
