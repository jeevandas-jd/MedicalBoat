In general, the symptoms of postherpetic neuralgia are limited to the area of skin where the shingles outbreak first happened. That's commonly in a band around the trunk of the body, most often on one side.
The symptoms might include:

Pain that lasts three months or longer after the shingles rash has healed. The pain may feel burning, sharp and jabbing. Or it may feel deep and aching.
Not being able to stand light touch. People with postherpetic neuralgia often can't bear even the touch of clothing on the affected skin.
Itching or loss of feeling. Less often, postherpetic neuralgia can cause an itchy feeling or numbness.
