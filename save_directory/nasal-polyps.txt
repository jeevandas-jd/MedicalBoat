Nasal polyps are linked to irritation and swelling, also called inflammation, of the inside of the nose and sinuses that lasts more than 12 weeks. This is known as chronic sinusitis. But it's possible to have chronic sinusitis without getting nasal polyps.
People who have small nasal polyps might not know they have them. But having more than one polyp or having a large polyp can block the nose.
Common symptoms of chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps include:

Runny, stuffy nose.
Mucus running down the throat, also known as postnasal drip.
Not being able to smell.
Not being able to taste.
Facial pain or headache.
Pain in the teeth.
A sense of pressure over the forehead and face.
Snoring.
