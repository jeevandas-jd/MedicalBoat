Hepatitis A symptoms typically appear a few weeks after you've had the virus. But not everyone with hepatitis A develops symptoms. If you do, symptoms can include:

Unusual tiredness and weakness
Sudden nausea and vomiting and diarrhea
Abdominal pain or discomfort, especially on the upper right side beneath your lower ribs, which is over your liver
Clay- or gray-colored stool
Loss of appetite
Low-grade fever
Dark urine
Joint pain
Yellowing of the skin and the whites of your eyes (jaundice)
Intense itching

These symptoms may be relatively mild and go away in a few weeks. Sometimes, however, hepatitis A results in a severe illness that lasts several months.
