Stuttering symptoms may include:

Having a hard time starting a word, phrase or sentence.
Stretching out a word or sounds within a word.
Repeating a sound, syllable or word.
Brief silence for certain syllables or words, or pausing before or within a word.
Adding extra words such as "um" if expecting to have problems moving to the next word.
A lot of tension, tightness or movement of the face or upper body when saying a word.
Anxiety about talking.
Not being able to communicate well with others.

These actions may happen when stuttering:

Rapid eye blinks.
Trembling of the lips or jaw.
Unusual face movements, sometimes called facial tics.
Head nodding.
Tightening of fists.

Stuttering may be worse when the person is excited, tired or under stress, or when feeling self-conscious, hurried or pressured. Situations such as speaking in front of a group or talking on the phone can be especially hard for people who stutter.
But most people who stutter can speak without stuttering when they talk to themselves and when they sing or speak along with someone else.
