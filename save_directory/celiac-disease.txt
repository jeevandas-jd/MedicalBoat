The symptoms of celiac disease can vary greatly. They also may be different in children and adults. Digestive symptoms for adults include:

Diarrhea.
Fatigue.
Weight loss.
Bloating and gas.
Abdominal pain.
Nausea and vomiting.
Constipation.

However, more than half the adults with celiac disease have symptoms that are not related to the digestive system, including:

Anemia, usually from iron deficiency due to decreased iron absorption.
Loss of bone density, called osteoporosis, or softening of bones, called osteomalacia.
Itchy, blistery skin rash, called dermatitis herpetiformis.
Mouth ulcers.
Headaches and fatigue.
Nervous system injury, including numbness and tingling in the feet and hands, possible problems with balance, and cognitive impairment.
Joint pain.
Reduced functioning of the spleen, known as hyposplenism.
Elevated liver enzymes.

ChildrenChildren with celiac disease are more likely than adults to have digestive problems, including:

Nausea and vomiting.
Chronic diarrhea.
Swollen belly.
Constipation.
Gas.
Pale, foul-smelling stools.

The inability to absorb nutrients might result in:

Failure to thrive for infants.
Damage to tooth enamel.
Weight loss.
Anemia.
Irritability.
Short stature.
Delayed puberty.
Neurological symptoms, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), learning disabilities, headaches, lack of muscle coordination and seizures.

Dermatitis herpetiformisGluten intolerance can cause this blistery skin disease. The rash usually occurs on the elbows, knees, torso, scalp or buttocks. This condition is often associated with changes to the lining of the small intestine identical to those of celiac disease, but the skin condition might not cause digestive symptoms.
Health care professionals treat dermatitis herpetiformis with a gluten-free diet or medicine, or both, to control the rash.
