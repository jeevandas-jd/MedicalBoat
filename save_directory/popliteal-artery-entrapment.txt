The main symptom of popliteal artery entrapment syndrome (PAES) is pain or cramping in the back of the lower leg. The back of the lower leg is called the calf. The pain occurs during exercise and goes away with rest. Other symptoms may include:

Cold feet after exercise.
Tingling or burning in your calf.
Numbness in the calf area.

If the nearby vein, called the popliteal vein, also becomes trapped by the calf muscle, you may have:

A heavy feeling in the leg.
Lower leg cramping at night.
Swelling in the calf area.
Changes in skin color around the calf muscle.
Blood clot in the lower leg, called deep vein thrombosis.

Symptoms typically affect young, otherwise healthy people under age 40.
