FeaturesPeople with kleptomania usually have these features or characteristics:

Unlike most shoplifters, people with kleptomania don't compulsively steal for personal gain, on a dare, for revenge or out of rebellion. They steal simply because the urge is so powerful that they can't resist it.
Episodes of kleptomania generally happen suddenly, without planning and without help from another person.
Most people with kleptomania steal from public places, such as stores. Some may steal from friends or acquaintances, such as at a party.
Often, the stolen items have no value to the person with kleptomania, and the person can afford to buy them.
The stolen items are usually stashed away, never to be used. Items also may be donated, given away to family or friends, or even secretly returned to the place from which they were stolen.
Urges to steal may come and go or may occur with greater or lesser intensity over the course of time.
