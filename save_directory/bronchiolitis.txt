SymptomsFor the first few days, the symptoms of bronchiolitis are much like a cold:

Runny nose.
Stuffy nose.
Cough.
Sometimes a slight fever.

Later, your child may have a week or more of working harder than usual to breathe, which may include wheezing.
Many infants with bronchiolitis also have an ear infection called otitis media.
