Genital warts are a common sexually transmitted infection. They can appear on the genitals, in the pubic area or in the anal canal.





Genital warts can grow on the:

Vulva.
Walls of the vagina.
Area between the outer part of the genitals and the anus.
Anal canal.
Cervix.
Tip or shaft of the penis.
Scrotum.
Anus.

Genital warts also can form in the mouth or throat of a person who has had oral sex with an infected person.
The symptoms of genital warts include:

Small swellings in the genital area that may be skin-colored or a different color.
A cauliflower-like shape caused by a few warts close together.
Itching or discomfort in your genital area.
Bleeding with sex.

Genital warts can be so small and flat that you can't see them. But rarely, they can multiply into large clusters in someone with a weakened immune system.
