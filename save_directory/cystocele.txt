In mild cases of anterior prolapse, you may not notice any signs or symptoms. When signs and symptoms occur, they may include:

A feeling of fullness or pressure in your pelvis and vagina
In some cases, a bulge of tissue in your vagina that you can see or feel
Increased pelvic pressure when you strain, cough, bear down or lift
Problems urinating, including difficulty starting a urine stream, the feeling that you haven't completely emptied your bladder after urinating, feeling a frequent need to urinate or leaking urine (urinary incontinence)

Signs and symptoms often are especially noticeable after standing for long periods of time and may go away when you lie down.
