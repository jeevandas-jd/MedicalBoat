Dystonia affects different people in different ways. Muscle spasms might:

Begin in a single area, such as your leg, neck or arm. Focal dystonia that begins after age 21 usually starts in the neck, arm or face. Although it tends to remain in the single area, it may spread to a neighboring area of the body.
Occur during a specific action, such as writing by hand.
Worsen with stress, fatigue or anxiety.
Become more noticeable over time.

Areas of the body that can be affected include:

Neck. When the neck muscles are involved, it's called cervical dystonia. Contractions cause the head to twist and turn to one side. Or the head may pull forward or backward. Cervical dystonia sometimes causes pain.
Eyelids. When muscles controlling eye blinks are involved, it's called blepharospasm. Rapid blinking or muscle spasms that cause your eyes to close make it hard to see. The muscle spasms usually aren't painful. They might increase in bright light or while reading, watching TV or interacting with people. They also might increase under stress. The eyes might feel dry, gritty or sensitive to light.
Jaw or tongue. When the muscles of the jaw and tongue are affected, it's called oromandibular dystonia. It can cause slurred speech, drooling, and trouble chewing or swallowing. This type of dystonia can be painful. It often occurs with cervical dystonia or blepharospasm.
Voice box and vocal cords. When the voice box or vocal cords are affected, it's called laryngeal dystonia. It can cause a strained or whispering voice.
Hand and forearm. Some types of dystonia occur only while doing an activity over and over, such as writing or playing a musical instrument. These are known as writer's dystonia and musician's dystonia. Symptoms usually don't happen when the arm is at rest.
