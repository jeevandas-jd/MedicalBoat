Symptoms of DiGeorge syndrome can vary based on what body systems are affected and the severity of the problems. Some symptoms may be clear at birth, but others may not appear until later in infancy or as a young child, or as an adult.
Symptoms of DiGeorge syndrome may include:

Heart issues, such as problems with the structure of the heart and vessels, or a heart murmur and bluish skin because of poor circulation of blood, also known as cyanosis.
Frequent infections.
Distinctive facial features, such as an underdeveloped chin, ears that look different, wide-set eyes, hooded eyes and an enlarged nose tip. Asymmetric crying facies also may be present. This is when muscles on one side of the mouth don't develop fully, causing that side of the mouth to droop when crying, though the face looks balanced at rest.
A gap in the roof of the mouth, also known as a cleft palate, or other problems with the palate.
A hard time feeding, failure to gain weight or stomach problems.
Hearing loss.
Poor muscle tone.
Kidney problems.
Poor vision and other eye problems.
Low levels of calcium in the blood.
Scoliosis.

 Other symptoms may include:

Delayed growth.
Delayed development, such as delays in rolling over, sitting up or other infant milestones.
Delayed speech development or nasal-sounding speech.
Learning delays or disabilities.
Behavioral problems.
