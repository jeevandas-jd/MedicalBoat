Most small hiatal hernias cause no symptoms. But larger hiatal hernias can cause:

Heartburn.
Backward flow of swallowed food or liquids into the mouth, called regurgitation.
Backflow of stomach acid into the esophagus, called acid reflux.
Trouble swallowing.
Chest or abdominal pain.
Feeling full soon after you eat.
Shortness of breath.
Vomiting of blood or passing of black stools, which could mean bleeding in the digestive tract.
