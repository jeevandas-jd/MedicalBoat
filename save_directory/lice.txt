Head lice


Head lice
Head lice feed on blood from the scalp. The female louse lays eggs (nits) that stick to hair shafts.





Common signs and symptoms of lice include:

Intense itching on the scalp, body or in the genital area.
A tickling feeling from movement of hair.
The presence of lice on your scalp, body, clothing, or pubic or other body hair. Adult lice may be about the size of a sesame seed or slightly larger.
Lice eggs (nits) on hair shafts. Nits may be difficult to see because they're very tiny. They're easiest to spot around the ears and the nape of the neck. Nits can be mistaken for dandruff, but unlike dandruff, they can't be easily brushed out of hair.
Sores on the scalp, neck and shoulders. Scratching can lead to small red bumps that can sometimes get infected with bacteria.
Bite marks, especially around the waist, groin, upper thighs and pubic area.
