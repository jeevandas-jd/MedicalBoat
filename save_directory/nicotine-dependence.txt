For some people, using any amount of tobacco can quickly lead to nicotine dependence. Signs that you may be addicted include:

You can't stop smoking. You've made one or more serious, but unsuccessful, attempts to stop.
You have withdrawal symptoms when you try to stop. Your attempts at stopping have caused physical and mood-related symptoms, such as strong cravings, anxiety, irritability, restlessness, difficulty concentrating, depressed mood, frustration, anger, increased hunger, insomnia, constipation or diarrhea.
You keep smoking despite health problems. Even though you've developed health problems with your lungs or your heart, you haven't been able to stop.
You give up social activities. You may stop going to smoke-free restaurants or stop socializing with family or friends because you can't smoke in these situations.
