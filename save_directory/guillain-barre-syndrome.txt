Guillain-Barre syndrome often begins with tingling and weakness starting in the feet and legs and spreading to the upper body and arms. Some people notice the first symptoms in the arms or face. As Guillain-Barre syndrome progresses, muscle weakness can turn into paralysis.
Symptoms of Guillain-Barre syndrome may include:

A pins and needles feeling in the fingers, toes, ankles or wrists.
Weakness in the legs that spreads to the upper body.
Unsteady walk or not being able to walk or climb stairs.
Trouble with facial movements, including speaking, chewing or swallowing.
Double vision or inability to move the eyes.
Severe pain that may feel achy, shooting or cramplike and may be worse at night.
Trouble with bladder control or bowel function.
Rapid heart rate.
Low or high blood pressure.
Trouble breathing.

People with Guillain-Barre syndrome usually experience their most significant weakness within two weeks after symptoms begin.
TypesThe symptoms of Guillain-Barre syndrome can vary based on the type. Guillain-Barre syndrome has several forms. The main types are:

Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP), the most common form in North America and Europe. The most common sign of AIDP is muscle weakness that starts in the lower part of the body and spreads upward.
Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS), in which paralysis starts in the eyes. MFS also is associated with an unsteady walk. MFS is less common in the U.S. but more common in Asia.
Acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) and acute motor-sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN) are less common in the U.S. But AMAN and AMSAN are more frequent in China, Japan and Mexico.
