Trigeminal neuralgia results in pain occurring in an area of the face supplied by one or more of the three branches of the trigeminal nerve.






Trigeminal neuralgia symptoms may include one or more of these patterns:

Episodes of intense shooting or jabbing pain that may feel like an electric shock.
Sudden episodes of pain or pain triggered by touching the face, chewing, speaking or brushing your teeth.
Episodes of pain lasting from a few seconds to several minutes.
Pain that occurs with facial spasms.
Episodes of pain lasting days, weeks, months or longer. Some people have periods when they experience no pain.
Pain in areas supplied by the trigeminal nerve. These areas include the cheek, jaw, teeth, gums or lips. Less often, the eye and forehead may be affected.
Pain on one side of the face at a time.
Pain focused in one spot. Or the pain may be spread in a wider pattern.
Pain that rarely occurs while sleeping.
