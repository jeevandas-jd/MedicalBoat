Symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis may include:

Shortness of breath.
Dry cough.
Extreme tiredness.
Weight loss that's not intended.
Aching muscles and joints.
Widening and rounding of the tips of the fingers or toes, called clubbing.

How fast pulmonary fibrosis worsens over time and how severe the symptoms are can vary greatly from person to person. Some people become ill very quickly with severe disease. Others have moderate symptoms that worsen more slowly, over months or years.
When symptoms suddenly get worseIn people with pulmonary fibrosis, especially idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, shortness of breath can suddenly get worse over a few weeks or days. This is called an acute exacerbation. It can be life-threatening. The cause of an acute exacerbation may be another condition or an illness, such as a lung infection. But usually the cause is not known.
