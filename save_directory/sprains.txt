Sprained ankle


Sprained ankle
A sprained ankle is the stretching or tearing of ankle ligaments, which support the joint by connecting bones to each other.





Signs and symptoms will vary, depending on the severity of the injury, and may include:

Pain
Swelling
Bruising
Limited ability to move the affected joint
Hearing or feeling a "pop" in your joint at the time of injury

When to see the doctorMild sprains can be treated at home. But the injuries that cause sprains can also cause serious injuries, such as fractures. You should see a doctor if you:

Can't move or bear weight on the affected joint
Have pain directly over the bones of an injured joint
Have numbness in any part of the injured area
