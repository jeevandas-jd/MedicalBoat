If you have an overactive bladder, you may:

Feel a sudden urge to urinate that's hard to control.
Lose urine without meaning to after an urgent need to urinate, called urgency incontinence.
Urinate often. This can mean eight or more times in 24 hours.
Wake up more than twice a night to urinate, called nocturia.

Even if you can get to the toilet in time when you feel an urge to urinate, having to urinate often during day and night can disrupt your life.
